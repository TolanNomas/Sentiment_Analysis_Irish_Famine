There was a dark misty fog. Though the sharper weather observers said it might blow all were not agreed on the point.But if indications of a mere earthly order were few those of a spiritual nature were not lacking to the same extent. As a Boffin crew of four left Boffin horbour they saw another boat following them with a crew of three.

After a while a storm arose and the smooth blue sea became a sea of great big waves and foam and spray. Soon a monstrous wave lifted the canoe and threw the occupants into the sea. Pat was the only one able to swim, one man was drowned immediately but he caught one man in his hand, the other with his mouth. Then he swam with the two men to the shore. There were neighbours on the shore to help him in. One of the rescued men were unconscous and himself was out of breath.\n",

The old man who told me about the famine said that it was sent as a punishment from god on the people, because the year before it happened potatoes grew very well, so well indeed that the people  could not use them and they were left to decay in the pits. The next year however the blight destroyed the whole crop in one night. When the farmers awoke they found they stalks and leaves withered and blackened as if by frost but this was impossible as it was the month of June. Anybody who had any potatoes to sow the following year were awarded by a fine crop. The people died of hunger and of course their half starved relatives were not able to bury them properly. They graveyards were filled to overflowing and many were buried on the roadside or in the fields. The poor houses or work houses were also filled and the people were turned away to die by the roadside. Disease spread with the famine an those who did not die from starvation died of disease. Many people are buried along on the Keelogues road\n",

In that year there was nothing done to relieve distress.  Although the Potato crop failed there was abundance of food in the country.  Fields and roads were thronged with dead and dying.\n",

On some occasions his return journey went far into the night and he always had the misfortune to meet a terrible monster on these late returns. It took the shape of a human being with one eye and this eye was in the middle of his forehead - as big as a cart wheel (the priest's own description).Fortunately enough for the priest he always carired the stole with him and the monster did nothing but gaze and pass by.

The defenders saluted the attackers with a shower of boiling water and lime. The defenders had taken hives of bees into the house with them to fling on the evicting party. The attack lasted four hours but failed to gain addmission. All the defenders were employed that night making Saunders house stranger. They built the walls inside the doors and indows more water was boiled. On Saturday August 22 they came again but found Saunders house stronger than ever. All that day they kept them out and at last the sheriff Reddington gave it up and went back to Portumna. They did not come again until August the 29 a week later. They were delayed at Monakeeva bridge which was broken down. They arrived as Saunders house however and demanded possession but were refused. They placed shelter sheds against the walls of the house to save themselves. Those inside the house rolled large stones down the top of the sheds. For two hours the defenders defended the house with sticks and stones, gaffs, boat hook and swarms of bees that were trown from the roof, and such quantites of boiling water that they were badly burnt and their  clothes destroyed.

The potato crop failed and the people were in a very bad way for food.2 In poor parts around here the people had nothing to eat only meal, porridge, and they go so weak from this food that they died.3 They were so poor that several had to be buried without coffins and were buried in fields as they were dying so fast they could not be brought long journeys to the graveyard.4 the famine lasted for about two years. The poor people had not seed potatoes to sow as they had no money. Then the government gave round seed potatoes which they got from England and Scotland.\n",

At that time the potato was the chief food of the Irish people so that when it failed the people had not other food and they died in thousands.At that time every farmer had about five acres of land.

The year of the famine was a very wet year and the crops were covered with water for about two months and every one of the potatoes rotted in the ridges.

The potatoe became the chief food of the Irish in or about the year 1700.  Nearly 400,000 people perished in Munster when the crop failed in 1740.  Between 1800 and 1845 there were potatoe famines in several districts, but the famine which began in 1845 was far worse than any of these.  In that year potatoe blight appeared in Ireland for the first time.  It spread quickly and the crop failed all over the country.  Thousands died of sickness and starvation in the Winter of 1845-46.  Raw turnips, weeds and sea weeds were commonly eaten.  The next Winter 1847 was far more terrible than the last.  Roads and fields, towns and villages were thronged with dead and dying people.

The following year when they were digging out the potatoes they would only find a very odd one here and there,  Many people emigrated from their homes to seek refuge in distant lands as they were not able to meet their debts at home.  When these people went away they left their homes and their lands behind them and those who were not able to emigrate had to seek refuge in the Co. Home. Those unfortunate people who were in the Co.

The cause of the famine was that the people depended entirely on potatoes and they set not other crops, and the potato crop failed and they had nothing to eat. All the potatoes did not fail the first year and the people managed to save them and set them again the next year and they failed altogether and the people had nothing at all to eat and they died in thousands with starvationThere was also a great plague at that time which was due to the starvation The people could not afford to buy coffins for anyone that would die so they would be buried wherever they died.

      "Transcription: About two hundred years ago or more there was a strange sickness all over the world. The sickness was called the famine. Everybody who took it was buried in the nearest place they got ground. The people who were alive buried those victims in \"cleeves\" (cliabh) or anything they thought fit enough to hold them. The cause of this sickness was hunger. It was not because they had no money to buy food, but they could  get no food to buy.At last some people who knew nothing about the True Faith set up a house in Achill where they boiled stirabout and anybody who preferred to turn into jumpers was welcome to eat enough of stirabout.  So a good many people turned into jumpers for the sake of a pot of stirabout.Bríghid Nic Aodháinó n-a h-athair(1) Sean Mac Aodháin(2) An Ceathramha Saileach An Ceathramha Bheag(3)  55(4) Feilméara\n",

      "Transcription: Stories of the Famine, Evictions, etc.There is scarcely anybody living at the present day, who can remember the famine years, but there are many old legends and stories handed down to us from our ancestors connected with those terrible years. My father told me an old story about Rafftery, an old blind travelling poet. who used to go around the country looking for alms. One day during the famine, he went into a house near Headford, and asked for an alm and he got no answer, he asked a few times; and getting no answer, he went on his knees cursing the inhabitants of the house. But before he got off his knees, his sight was restored to him, and he never forgot the sight that met his eyes. On the floor were the corpses of three persons, and on a bed, were two more people dying with the hunger. Rafftery went on his knees, and prayed to God to take away his sight from him again lest he might ever see another sight of that kind, his sight was taken from him again, and it was then Rafftery composed the well known \"Repentance\" called \"[?] Rafftery\". My father has a copy of this, and it was written by my grand-father long ago.Nora Ni Dubdha.(From Father, James Dowd,Cahernabrook. Shrule, 65yrs.)\n",

It left the people round this district sinking into their graves in hundreds for want of food. It was in 1847 that the highest point of misery and death had been reached. Fever then set in to add to the horrors of famine.My grandfather told me that there was not  a domestic animal to be seen from  Ballinrobe to Connemara - pigs and poultry had all died.There were soup houses set up here and there, and soup could be got at one penny a quart, but many people died of hunger rather than go to the soup kitchens.The soupers, as the people in charge were called, very often offered free soup to those Catholics who would change their religion.One such soup kitchen was at Tourmakeady. There were soup kitchens in nearly every district, but in this district it was not made much use of as the people had a fairly good supply of oats, which they ground, and made oaten bread and porridge from it.The Ballinrobe Workhouse was crowded and the deaths\n",

So one day when they were talking my uncle said: -\"You have given me good example every night. I love to listen to you saying the Rosary as I pass.\"\"Sir\", said he, as long as I have life in me I'll say the Rosary and I'll tell you why. When the Famine was worst my family and myself were starving. One night the children were crying with the hunger but there was no food for them. By way of stopping their cries they were put to bed, but after a short sleep they woke with louder cries for food. At last I thought it well that all of us, young and old, should join in saying the Rosary. We did and before it was ended a woman came in. Her occupation was to deal in bread, and she had a basketful with her.I explained our condition to her, and asked her to give me some bread on credit.

It is related that the two rivals rode on horse-back to the battle ground. When Miller was shot he mounted his horse and was able to reach his house, about a mile away. His horse jumped over the gate leading from the main road into the demesne. He survived only a short time after reaching home. He received the fatal wound in the stomach. It is alleged that prior to the duel he remarked that he would rather have a hole in his pudding than a hole in his honour.The bullet which proved fatal was a double one connected by a chain or link. Millar's wife took legal proceedings against Browne alleging that, owing to the kind of bullet used by him, he was guilty of murder.

They grew up in fine healthy stalks but the blight fell on them again and they all rotted.  The next year - the spring of 1848, the priest advised the people off the alter not to sow potatoes at all.  One man named Walsh didn't like the advice and he sowed an acre of potatoes.

What was the plight of the poor Irish people when faced with this famine due to the failure of the potato crop? Men, Women and children died in thousands in their houses and on the roadside. An abundant crop was reaped those years but due to the landlords and English Government it was shipped to England to feed the people of England and the Irish people had to exist on the potato as their staple food. It speaks well for a country which is called non Christian that the Turkish Government were the first to send aid to the stricken Irish people. They sent cargos of Indian corn. But the suffering of the stricken Irish people due to the mismanahement and callous English Government will not be forgotten by the Irish people. of of the nation.

The people  were ignorant then and did not know anything about spraying. That year the potatoes rotted in the pits. The year following they failed  in the drills because  of the bad seed. I have heard of men, who spent days digging and were very glad to return with a pocket-full of Póiridé  - or small potatoes to cook for the supper.The following year the Government gave Relief seed called Champions. They were sown in drills and ridges, with very little manure from the farm-yards. Some had good crops and others bad. Those who had not good crops were discouraged and would not put  them down again, but those who did  had an abundant crop.Instead of the food the people had before the famine, they had to do with turnips, sometimes boiled and often raw. They also ate grass and roots. Those who lived near the sea  ate shell-fish, such as perri-winkles and Báirneachi, they also ate Dilisc and  Carrigeen-moss and other different kinds of sea-weed.The Government then gave relief to the starving people by sending Indian meal all through the country,\n",

So when the potato crop failed the people saw nothing before them but starvation. All the potatoes they used to grow in olden times would not amount to half of what we grow nowadays. What they had during the famine years were not worth digging. They would start digging in the morning and they would not have the fill of a bucket in the evening which was a very small supply for a big family.Some people dug them and as they were too small to plant as usual they shook them as we shake oats nowadays and covered them with a grape.It is said that those who sowed them in this manner had a fair crop the following year.The famine affected this district in this way, hundreds died from hunger and from the effects of the famine and fever which always follows hunger\n",

      "Transcription: Great Famine.The Great Famine was one of the most terrible events in Irish history. It began in 1845. It lasted for two years. It was caused by the failure of the potato crop.A man thought he was lucky at that time after working all day in the field he had in the evening a pocket full of potatoes the size of marbles.People who were rich before the famine had to eat weeds and seaweed they were so hungry. Thousands died from starvation.As there were no newspapers in those days it was a long time before the people in England heard anything about the famine. As soon as they heard about it they sent over ship loads of “Indian Meal.”At first when the English gave the Irish the meal they were so hungry they did not wait to cook it but ate it just as it was as they had been so long without food the raw meal killed them as quickly as starvation so the English had to cook the meal for them in huge boilers on the Coach road. Sometimes this road is called a “stirabout” road.The men had to work before they got a can of porridge. A lot of the work they did was building\n",

The woman in the house thought he looked thinner than he had been. He told her he had not eaten anything for a week. She gave him a bowl of porridge. He ate it. He then went out and lay down in the Commons and died from overfeeding after starvation.He was peculiar as he carried his bed on his back. When he went into a house he stood in the middle of the kitchen and he looked all around it. If he saw and wanted a bit of bacon or any other food he would sing\"God bless Mrs Blakeney with the fine bit of bacon and the round, merry round, merry round.In the Autumn of 1847 the people died \"like flies\" in Easkey. They did not make coffins for them but threw them into a big hole. One night there was terrible crying heard. None of the people went out. It was a dark night. They were afraid. They thought it was ghosts. In the morning they saw one man had been buried alive and had got up and staggered over to the wall for shelter. Often they did not even bury them in the graveyard but in a ditch or field in order to save time. The fathers of the children used to go away from the house during the day. They could not bear the hear the cries of the children.Written by:-Constance Carroll,Frankford,Enniscrone\n",

Most of the scholars got no account of it from their parents or grandparents. And the accounts brought by the others were only of a general nature - just the few facts that can be picked up from history books. Only in one case was anything of a special kind brought in.Patrick Mullarkey of Raforra (?) was able to give us some recollections of his grandfather. There was nothing very new in these  -  the old man did not seem to have retained any vivid memories of the time. An incident impressed itself so much on his mind that the picture always remained with him. On the same street with him lived a farmer whose wife was one of the victims of the Famine. Old Mullarkey saw the bereaved husband taking out his donkey in the dusk of an evening. He fixed the  two creels on the animal, then going   into the house he brought out his dead wife in his arms and placed her across the creels  -  the feet on one creel and the head supported by a bundle of hay on the other.  He then mounted himself behind the creels (?)  -  he was unable to walk and go  he brought his sad burden to the graveyard more than three miles away.

In many places traces of large villages are seen where the inhabitants were all wiped out by the “famine”.So great indeed was the number dead that coffins could not be procured and the dead were rolled up in blankets or sheets and buried in roughly dug graves. In Boyle a cart went around collecting the dead bodies and the old people say that it was a pitiful sight to see the cart with its tragic load travelling along the street followed by a few famished mourners.The Government relief was a great boon to the poor starved people. Loaves of “Black Bread” and bags of “Indian Meal” were to be seen every Sunday at the Chapel gate. These were distributed among the very poor.\n",

Donoghue mufled his oars and went out in a boat. He stuck the whale with his long knife under the mouth and killed the whale. The whale was a hundred feet long. A crowd of men gathered and tied ropes on the whale. Then they brought it up to the boiler and boiled (it) the whale in pieces. Then every body got as much of it as they wanted. They sold the whale bone and got a lot of money for it.\n",

The government gave Indian meal to make the stirabout and they used to give it to the people. That year there were no potatoes dug and the ridges are still to be seen.

This accounts for the large number of Irish in America at the present time.

When they had begun to dig they discovered the most of the crop had decayed in the ground. When all the potatoes were gone the people began to eat turnips raw as they were too weak to boil them.\n",

      "Transcription: In the year of the famine about the year 46 the population of Ireland was large, larger that it is now.  According to the old peoples statements there were no potatoes nor no foreign food coming across to this country.  Anyone who had the luck to have any potatoes they were very small.  It was well know that whoever had them though small they were cut the eyes out and a small part of the potato attached to them and planted them and used the remaining part.  It was well known that families used eat cabbage leaves and salt without anything else until the turnips grew large enough to eat them.  Through that poverty a disease called the cholera set in and they died by the roadside so quick that the clergy could not attend them.  So plentiful that they had to make pits for them.  An organisation was started to give them relief by giving out what they called a poor mail\n",

The widow did as she was told and she found not only the cow but a calf as well. The cow gave plenty of milk all year except during the winder when she went dry. The widow was again sorely troubled and again the little woman came to her aid. She told the widow to leave the cow back in the fort at night, and on the following morning she would find another cow in her stead. Every winter the same thing happened.

In the year 1846 the potatoe crop was very good and the people had heaps of potatoes. In the Spring of 1847 when the people started turning their potatoes they found that they were all soft and were not fit for use or fit to be set again. The wheat and oats crops did not fail so the big farmers who had plenty of wheat and oats lived but the poorer class died. The year after, the people had to get potatoes imported into the country. The poorer class dug in their bogs for \"briscains\" which are white roots and tried to keep themselves alive by eating them. People died in dozens in this district because the old people say that plenty of people died on the roads and are buried inside the ditches. There was a man named Bohely he died with hunger when he was going in on a gap and he is buried in the gap and it is still called Bohel's gap. There is a big stone in a field near our school a man is buried under it who died during the famine. My grandmother said that people going on carts and on horses fell dead with hunger. There was another famine since but a slighter one because very few people died.

      "Transcription: The famine started in Ireland in the year 1846. The year before the famine there was a lot of potatoes and the people threw the potatoes in the ditches. The next year the blight fell on the potato crop and it failed and the people had nothing to eat. The people were dying in thousands behind the ditches and everywhere. After some time the government got Indian meal for the people and there was a boiler set up in every district and every man got a measure for his house. When the people got the food it was too strong and it killed some of them. They were buried everywhere, and they could get no wood to make coffins and sometimes people would break up furniture to make coffins. The next year some people sowed the small potatoes broadcast on the ground and anyone that did it had a good crop the next year. That was the first of the blight in Ireland and it has remained in Ireland ever since.\n",

During the famine the were not so badly off as the other people and generally managed to have a bag of oaten meal in the house.  The were very much carried by their less fortunate neighbours though they had not a great deal of riches, and were just a little farther from starvation than their neighbours.  One night Mrs Reilly went to bed and left about a quarter hundred of oatmeal in a little bag in the kitchen.  About daybreak she heard a noise in the kitchen and paid no heed to it at the time.  Then she began to wonder was anything wrong.  She got up and found the door open and the meal gone.  She looked out and saw a woman a few fields away with the bag on her back.  She recognised the thief and at first was going after her.  Then she changed her mind and went in.  \"That woman came here to save a starving family\", she said, \"and God wouldn't forgive me if I kept it from her\".\n",

      "Transcription: The remains of the monastry in Cloone graveyard may be of later origin than the time of St. Creigharee. The building is of modern design and does not bear any resemblance to 5th century masonry. I believe that St. Creighanee had his monastry or cells at Drumhaskin Glebe. This tract of land is fertile and for generations has been in the possession of protestants of the tilled class. The lands are called the Grange and the Rectory. The Grange was owned by the Whites and Fitzpatricks, who were titled people in England and the parson lived in the Rectory till recent years. We generally find that the English resided on the lands of the old monastries and that is why I claim that St Creigharees monastry was in the Glebe and not far from the place where his holy well commemorates his name.\n",

      "Transcription: Famine TimesIn the years of 1846-47 the blight came and destroyed the potato crop. The people depended greatly on the potato crop at that time and when it failed they were heart-broken. They had to sell their oats to pay their big rents because the landlords had them crushed down and if the people did not pay their rents they would be put out of their lands and they might go where they liked. Thousands of people died on the roadsides and in the fields. Then used to be boilers of thin porridge made in some places to relieve the starvation for the people. There was one of these boilers at Charlie Lees of Carrickavoher and another at Aughavas post office gate and the people used to go twice a day with their noggins and spoons to get some of this porridge. The potatoes were only about the size of marbles and some people saved them for seed. They put them into chests and nailed down the lid until the following Spring and then they set them and the ridges were full of potatoes the following harvest. The Government did very little for the people except to give them a little Indian meal.

      "Transcription: As most of the old people that were born about the time of the famine of 1846 have passed to the great beyond, it is surely timely to revive some of the stories often told by them to the youths of Ireland. Most people know there were a million beef cattle exported during 1846-1847 while the people were starving to death. And often a man or woman would call at a land lord's estate and ask for something to eat; if it happened to be on a certain day of the week they were offered a chunk of meat, if they accepted it mean't that they had denied their religion and when they turned away with a \"No thank you\" they were laughed at Most of the boys and girls of Corrduff school know of \"Crag Bush\" That bush was planted by a young girl. A small boy called at her home for something to eat, and after a hearty meal the poor little fellow was dead in a few hours; he was buried in a field on the hill of Corriga and to mark the grave she planted that bush. There is one more story I want to make known; it is about a Mary Hollywood. She was the daughter of Irish parents born in U.S.A. She taught school among the Indians, and in reading a newspaper she saw where a handful of meal would save a life in Ireland. She went to the governor of the State, and the next day had him dispatch 10,000 bushels of wheat on sail boat relief. When the ship was ten days out there blew a storm and the crew and all were lost.

They had to bury them in the nearest field. They had nothing to eat. They used to be out hunting every day after hares and rabbits and fishing. When they would be fishing they were so hungry, the first fish that they would catch they would put on a fire and roast him and eat him. Potatoes and oats were very scarce in those days. The rats and other animals gathered into they graveyards and ate the dead bodies. In the Penal days, the priests used to say Mass in the valleys and in rocks. The Catholics could not go to Mass in those days. There was a priest named Father Michael Curran who used to say Mass in the valleys. He was saying Mass in the one place for a long time. One Sunday, when he was after beginning Mass he saw the Soldiers coming. He ran as hard as he could, but the Soldiers caught him and shot him. Most of the other people got away. This priest lived in the Parish of Ballinamuck.\n",

Her father bought the corn from those who needed the money and then sold them back the oatmeal in small quantities as they wanted it, and also to others who had no corn of their own. People for miles around came buying the meal in pennyworths even, because as my grandmother told me the demand was so great that they had to charge all and try not to give it to any one who needed for other than human consumption. She being the eldest girl did the dealing out of the meal and often she said that at the end of the day a seven stone sack was filled with coppers.Her father and her brothers went through the country and bought all the oats they could get brought\n",

They will know that if they have not a \"full\" crop of potatoes it will be a serious matter for them, and they recall years when the yield did not reach the average and the scarcity of food and the high prices of potatoes which followed. The old people recall the stories they heard about the Great Famine of 1846-47 and they picture the sufferings of the people in the district and the great number that died of starvation and disease.They also say that the district was very thickly populated before that time and they point out sites of houses which were then occupied and of which there is now hardly a track.It is said that the blight appeared in brown spots on the leaves, that it soon spread all over the plants and that the stems fell down and decayed.  The late crop of 1845 failed completely and as potatoes were almost the only food the people had - for bread and meat were luxuries - almost unknown by the poor, painful stories are told of the want of food and of the sufferings of this class.  The people had to take their corn to the mill to ward off starvation.  The hens ceased to lay and they were obliged to sell them to buy a meal.  Indian meal was the food of the poor, but this, too, was dear and few could buy it.  Government relief works were started in the district, and some employment was given\n",

      "Transcription: In 1846 the Great Famlne was raging in Ireland.  It was directly caused by a failure of the potato crop.  The potato was the chief food of the people at that time.Thousands of people perished in 1846 with starvation and others died with disease.  They had to eat raw turnips, weeds and sea weed.  Then they went through the fields and gathered wild weeds which they used boil and eat with salt.The next year was far more terrible than that last year.  It was called \"Black Forty Seven\".The roads and fields, towns and villages were thronged with dead and dying.  Old people say that Ireland suffered many wars and invasions.  But the people never suffered as much as they did in \"Black Forty Seven\".\n",

The shops were shut. Great fires blazed at the corners of the streets to purify they air. At the government stores starving people dipped their hand into the boiling maize or Indian meal and swallowed the burning food. A priest was called from his bed at every night.

      "Transcription: In Lisavilla on the left of the road leading from Elphin to Hillstreet is an old lone whitethorn bush which is a grim landmark known as the 'Parson's Bush'.  Just ninety one years ago on November 2nd 1847 there occurred there the shooting of Rev. John Lloyd, Smith Hill, Elphin who was returning from Divine Service in Aughrim.  It appears the Rev. gentleman was what was then known as a middle landlord and the misguided men were under the belief that his death would solve the agrarian difficulties then prevalent.  Three men engaged in the attack but the first failed whereupon the second took the gun.   The clergyman saw and divined the intentions of the men and baring his breast bade them 'fire away' facing with proud courage his assailants whereupon he was shot dead.  In the horse-drawn trap was a youth named Stanley with the Rev. J. Lloyd.  Stanley afterwards identified his master's murderers.  Two of the men paid the extreme penalty and one whilst awaiting trial died in his cell.  The clergyman's religion had no connection with the cause of the attack.  Great regret in all circles existed around Elphin on learning of the outrage as the Rev. gentleman was an excellent employer and a very charitable neighbour in those distant and awful times when famine swept the land.\n",

He erected a gallows in Grange, any one he would find trespassing on his land he would have him hanged  or shot. As he was always riding or walking over these lands, it happened that he met a soldier of the Irish coming home on parole. At that time there were no bicycles nor motors they had to walk from the nearest port to their homes. He took a short cut home across these lands. He had to take his gun and napsack home with him and some rounds of ammunition Getting tired he sat by the wall to rest himself. Robert asked the soldier why he was trespassing on his land He took the soldier's gun and told him to go back where he came in on his land or he would shoot him with his own gun. The poor soldier had to do so as he was bidden. When Robert had him off his property he handed him back his gun \"Hi\" said the soldier \"My' boy you will have to carry me on your back and leave me where you got me or I will shoot you\" Robert the coward\n",

It took great effect on this district also.During the famine years thousands of people died. There was a blight on the potatoes and in those days the people were depending on the potatoes more than anything else. When the potatoes failed the people had nothing to eat only Indian meal and turnips, and some of the people were to be seen \"brisosgains\" out of the fields.The year after the famine the people of Ireland had to get seed potatoes from Scotland and some of them used to sow the buds of the potatoes. When the famine was nearly over the English sent over indian meal and they afterwards started the Public works in Ireland such as, making roads and ditches to give the people a chance to work. They had to work for fourpence a day and some of them only got a half stone of Indian meal. The English Government also gave fifty pounds to the Irish.

The following is an account of it given to me by my father.The population at that time was almost double what it is now, and a good many people died of hunger, whilst others of emigrated to England, Scotland, Canada and the United States, to escape death from hunger at home. At the start it was not so bad as the people could eat porridge. When all the oat meal was used up the\n",

Fifty or sixty years ago the landlord's agent planned to mow it and to save the hay and carry it home. One very fine day he picked a number of men and they set out for the island with scythes for the purpose of mowing it. They landed on the island  but no sooner had they done so than the \"Shores\" suddenly rose. As quickly as possible they had to board their boat again and by all accounts they had a providential escape as they came very close to getting swamped in trying to get into the boat. I have heard that an old man who lived in the next townland  to my native home was one of the crew in that attempted mowing expedition to Oileán Aolbhach.

There were no motor-cars in the district at that time and the people used to travel from place to place in side cars. It was the custom to walk long distances to get a good price for butter and eggs. The people of this parish were accustomed to walk to Cork, and would often start on their journey in the morning and would be back on the following evening. They used take off their shoes and walk barefooted until they came near the town or city and would then put on her shoes. When they had their butter and eggs sold, they would leave the city and return home without any food.\n",

      "Transcription: The events which led up to the disastrous famine in Ireland in the year 1847 are only too well known to even the most casual observers of Irish history. The failure of the staple food of the people - the potato - in the preceding year and the taking away by the landlords of the grain crops left the eight millions of a population to succumb to starvation. Men, women and children felt the torture of a slow, agonising death. Fever dysentery and diseases of every possible kind seized them. Thousands perished by the roadside. Graveyards were filled with coffinless corpses. Whole families were wiped out, and those who survived were left a prey to every conceivable form of agony. The parish of Goleen may be taken as typical of many another rural area of the time. Its geographical position shows it to be very outlying, and with the methods of transport obtaining at the time, it may well be imagined what the state of the people was before help could reach them.A certain Captain Coffin, a military man who resided in the parish, wrote a description of the condition of the people and had it published. His disclosures attracted the attention of the Rev. F.F. French Protestant curate of Cloughjordan, Co. Tipperary.  To enquire into the matter and to effect any possible remedy[?]\n",

In after years he returned to Ireland and became the Bishop of Elphin.\n",

He thinks, however, the owed their lives to the occasional secret visit of a kind aunt. At the start of the sickness they happened to have a good supply of Indian meal and some flour stored in. Being the first to be knocked up himself he as the first to recover and after a survey of the surroundings he found that all their provisions had been stolen except for some small share of meal and flour which were in the house where they were all sick.About midday of the first day that he was able to get out of bed a poor man came, almost creeping to the yard begging for something to eat.

People died not only in their houses but in the fields, on the roads on the ditches and on the streets.So great was the want of food that the people ate grass and turf. They drew the blood of the cattle and drank it. In some places they killed and ate the donkeys that had served them on their little farms. So thickly did the people die of the famine that sometimes the dead were buried uncoffined in trenches.

      "Transcription: Miss Ellie Cronin (86 yrs) and her sister Miss Julia Cronin ([?] living at The Courthouse Knocknagree Co. Cork gave me a very clear and interesting account of happenings as far back as the famine years and before it. These were gleaned from their own memories and from stories they heard from the father and mother. Their father, John B. Cronin died in 1895 at the age of 97, and their mother died in January 1894 aged 75. John B. Cronin or as he was known Johnny Batt. was Mr Daniel Cronin Coltsman's right-hand man in this district and as will be seen through the two ladies mentioned above we get a fairly good idea of many things - but let Miss Ellie Cronin tell her story.Daniel Cronin Coltsman - the Landlord of Knocknagree and Nohoval had this house (the 'Courthouse') built in 1846 1847. It was originally intended as a Store-house for grain. In that year also he built a mill in front of the house.[map drawn on page, showing house, road, site of mill, river, mill-race, etc.]\n",

The dogs made so much noise that the owner came out and when he heard the movements in the outhouse he judged what was amiss. He slipped quietly to the door of the outhouse  - closed it and hasped it and left Moll a prisoner until morning. Moll's poor husband spent all that night with his finger in the baby's mouth trying to ease the pangs of hunger for it.Times were so bad, Ned Buckley and John C O'Herlihy told me that farmers had to watch their potato gardens when they were setting the sgioláns lest they (sgioláns) would be stolen. Many a farmer had his gun ready for such and eventuality.On the other hand, a farmer in Stake Hill (one of the Leaders) had a pit of turnips which he gave to anybody who wanted some but his rule was. \"Take one, or take two but take three and I'll take you'\n",

It was at that time, too, a poor family found a sack of meal lost near Tureencahill (Co. Kerry) and hid it in the bog. Every night the man of the house stole to the bag and brought a little can of meal to feed the family and that put them over the 'bad times'. The bog was named Bogac na Mine - now or since 1896 it is called the Moving Bog, and is sometimes referred to as the Bog of the 'Male' There was terrible famine in the Tureens - the Crown Lands - and the Government sent several families to America. Lots of people died. There was a certain family living in Tureen and they had nothing to eat. The wife was a fine tall elegant woman and the husband was a small hardy man. They were to be removed to the Model Farm to be fed and cared for for a short time before being sent to America. When the cart was sent for them they were discovered around a bit of fire crying.

The potatoes rotted in the pits, and from these Stampy Bread was made. Blight was noticed in Great Britain in 1845, as a black scab on the potato. Seed potatoes were distributed by the Unions to those, whose valuation was under five pounds. These potatoes were paid for by the Poor Rate afterwards. In some districts potatoes were planted with a spade in ridges, as at present day. In other districts, in a manner called \"Ríosg-ing\" (or fallow) The furrow was stripped and burned, the ashes being used as manure. The potatoes were planted four across in a four foot ridge.3. Food. - Stirabout made from Indian Meal, and mixed with Salt Herring was eaten. Soon a plague of \"Cholera\", broke out amongst the poor people, in Muingyroogen townland, and surrounding districts.

This blight destroyed the potato crop in the summer of 1845 and again in 1846. The first sign of blight showed after a great fog and a fierce storm. The leaves of the potato stalks showed brown in patches at first and then the disease spread very rapidly. In the earth the potatoes began to rot and when the farmers noticed this they dug them out and put them into pits. However this did not improve matters because the decay continued but before they were all completely destroyed some kind of *bread was made of them.The English government gave me help practically until the famine was far advanced, then they have money and seed potatoes to the Irish, but the suffering people were too week to undertake any work no matter how light, even the planting of the seed. Shiploads of Indian Corn and Indian meal were sent to the starving people by the Irish who had emigrated to America.

In our district, it is common when the old people meet, to discuss that dreadful time; and tell some of the stories to the younger folk.One of these stories is as follows. This family lived in Glen, and lived happily there previous to the famine. But when the potatoes failed, which was then their staple food, they were in great distress. The parents did their utmost to provide sufficient for a while, but soon had to surrender. They saw their dear little ones starve of hunger, one by one, until the six were gone.Then the mother, who had so far struggled on, fell victim, while her husband eat the very grass of the fields. He was the only member who survived, but not for a long period, as he had gone too far when relief came.\n",

Then the approach of Sunday without Mass, almost broke her heart. This Sunday however, she no longer remained at home, but attempted her fatal journey. She had scarcely a mile to walk, but it seemed endless to her. The Almighty however enabled her to get to Church before Mass had finished. She entered at the moment of the Elevation and fell dead saying \"Eternal Praises to the Son of God.\"When Mass was ended the poor creature was removed to her home, where her only son was found dead.Such were the occurrences of famine times.\n",

Consecrated ground was out of the question during that time.Two men were found dead in a house above Nadd. They were two brothers named Driscolls. They were sitting beside the fire just as if they were only resting. Many others died in a similar state at that time.There was a Mr. Twomey who held a small farm in the Derrygowna district at this time.

During the famine years the potato crops failed and on this account the people died of hunger as potatoes were their chief food.

After a few days they had what food was available in the house eaten and soon after all three died of hunger. When the neighbours found they were dead they gathered together and threw in the house on them. On another occasion a poor man called to Con Callaghan's house at Gloundine. There was a keeler of stirabout boiled and ready on the table for the family. Con's grandmother went to milk the cows and when she returned to the kitchen she found the stirabout was all ate and the old man was nowhere to be seen.

Their descendants now live in the parish of Glenworth in the townland of Johnstown. There never sent people away from their door. However when the famine sickness broke out, he saw eight deaths in the house in one week. He also told me that when cleaning a dyke in the farm many years after the famine he dug up two skulls probably of those who died by the ditch in those dreadful years.Rev. Father Piece Greene then parish priest of Killavullen relieved many of the starving people in those years. At the house now occupied by Mrs. Keating Killavullen, Indian meal, soup etc, was supplied to the people.She also said that the year previous to the famine was a very bountiful one as regards potatoes.\n",

He told my father that he saw people dying like flies by the roadside at that time, from hunger and famine fever. The sickness was so prevalent that it was hard to get people to bury the dead. James Regan told my father that he buried fourteen people from Castletownroche in one day in the local churchyard.All in the neighbourhood were sick or dying and James Regan had to bury the fourteen people himself unaided. He brought the corpses without coffins in a donkey car to the graveyard made a couple of good holes for them and buried the people in them.Ellen Barry an old woman who lived in Bridge St. Castletownroche told my father that she saw many people dying by the roadside in 1847. They had no food for days and when they got a supply of yellow meal to make porridge they ate it and their stomachs being so weak for want of food that it only killed them.\n",

The Protestant minister, Mr Ryder, lived at the time at Ballinterry and he used to have the tithes collected from the neighbouring farmers. The Widow Ryan and her son refused to pay. Parson Ryder called out the military and police from Fermoy to enforce payment. The neighbouring farmers assembled in large numbers to resist the seizure and were armed with Scythes, pikes billhooks etc. When the police & military arrived at the scene and found the large assemblage armed in such a dangerous manner and after they had made some show of resistance the commanding officer gave an order to fire and eight men including Widow Ryan's son were killed and about thirty or forty wounded. A battle ensued in which military & police were also wounded. Amongst those killed in this \"battle\" were two uncles of John Collins who resided in Ballyvinny about three miles from Watergrasshill and who died about nine years ago aged about 75 years. Some of those who were shot were buried in Gortroe Graveyard and others were buried in Ballinaltig graveyard.

He was a stranger to the woman and elegantly dressed. He told her hang her pot over the fire to get dinner for the family. She replied she had nothing to put in it. He said: \"Hang your pot over the fire and fill it with stones if you can get nothing else and see what will happen\" Then then he disappeared. So convincing was his manner, and as it was her only hope the woman did as he told her and when the pot boiled she found it filled with fine potatoes.

Many poor people used visit the lady who used always given them food in plenty. It happened that her husband was out of home for some days, and Sheila had many poor people at her house looking for alms. To all of them she gave some wheat seed that was in bags ready for sowing. When the master came home all the seed was given away by the woman of the house. She was afraid to tell him what she had done for he was not a good man by any means it seems, and so when he gave orders to his servants some short time afterwards to set the seed, they had nothing but chaff in the bags for sowing. Neverthless Sheila told them to set it, and that they could say the crop failed afterwards. The chaff was set, and wonderful to relate never did a finer crop of wheat spring up in that field. To this day it is known as \"the Chaffy Field.\"\n",

      "Transcription: During the year of the famine there was more grain exported from this country than was necessary to feed twice the population. This was due to English rule and the people had to depend on the potato crop as their whole means of food rather than starve. It effected the country very much. It was more populated at that time than now. The blight came on account of the bad weather. The potatoes rotted on the ground and in pits. There is a ruined house in Michael Murphy's farm and another in Griffin's and two in Dan Wren's. They got the seeds from Africa in 1846 and from America in 1847.\n",

It was commonly called \"the black forty-seven\" because in that the potatoes blackened in the drills and did not grow at all. There are a few old people in the surrounding district who can remember the privations and hardships of the famine period and could tell you some horrifying stories which you could not listen to. The principal food before the famine was potatoes and when the came they had no potatoes and they had to eat raw turnips wherever they could get them.When the people pulled the turnips in the famine period and when they were drawn in the poor people went out into the gardens and searched all the drills and picked up all the small turnips they could find and brought them home with them and boiled them and ate them with salt.\n",

The potatoes were an excellent crop and he reaped them and left them in pits in the garden. The following spring when the farmer wanted to plough his tillage he told the poor man to remove his potatoes. The man was in a quandary because he was not able to get rid of the potatoes, as they were so plentiful that nobody wanted them. After pondering for a while he harnessed his pony and drew them all back to the tide at Banna Strand and left them there.\n",

In those times a large number of people lived altogether on potatoes so that when the famine came many of them died with the hunger.  Before the famine there was twice the population in the locality of Ardfert.  Early potatoes rotted in the pits and the late potatoes rotted in the gardens.  When the potatoes were turning black they used to make stampy out of them.  My great grandmother saw a man dying on the road to Banna where he was going for sea grass.  During that time the English Government sent meal to relieve the people.  They used to make gruel out of the meal.  the people used to make gruel out of the meal.  the people used to eat nettles also with the  hunger.

The dead man was placed on a table. Then all the boys of the place came to the house and after a while they started throwing clods. The man of the house warned them but they started again soon after. About twelve o'clock that night the door was opened and four men entered the house. Then all the people in the house became very quiet.The men put the dead person into a coffin and they carried it out of the house. Then they called the man of the house out to see the funeral. They also told him that he would remember the night but for he caring the man the so well during the past thirty years. Then the funeral went to Dingle where the man was buried. It is said that the funeral consisted of dead people.\n",

On that day a train left Dingle with pigs and pig buyers for Tralee. At the steep incline down Glounagalt, the engine got out of control, and gaining speed as it dashed along, junped the rails  at Curraduff Bridge and was broken to pieces on the river bed several feet below, bringing the waggons laden with pigs, and the passenger carriage in which some pig buyers travelled, with it. The chain in the Guard's van snapped and it remained on the rails thus saving the Guard and some pig buyers, who travelled in the van as they had no room in the passenger carriage.The driver, Alfred Redshaw, and the fireman Richard Dillon, and a permanent-way inspector named Bernard O'Loughlin who came into the engine  at Dingle were killed. The late Thomas O'Leary of the Basin Station, Tralee was the guard of the train on the day of the disaster.

In the village of Burrens there were up to a hundred houses before the famine where there are only ten now. The old people still point out the sites of these houses which were mostly mud cabins.In 1845 there was a very bad potato crop in this district. In 1846 the potatoes rotted in the ground and people began to starve. Their food consisted of turnips or cabbage when they could be had. Sometimes they had nothing but the turnip leaves or nettle which they boiled and endeavoured to eat.Often corpses were seen by the roadside with the green stain of the nettles on their lips. Farmers who were lucky enough to have some cabbage had to guard it as people went roaming around searching for food and the farmer could not afford to give them anything or he would starve himself.\n",

In America the people who got it died, and their bodies turned black. It was known as the \"black flu\". Here in Ireland many people died. There lived in Gullane, Gneevguilla a man name Patrick O'Leary. He was so strong that he never tackled the ass to the car to bring a barrel of water. He pushed the car and barrel of water with his two hands. He got the flu and lived only one day. A young little girl named Bridget O'Leary who lived in Mausrour, Gneeveguilla got the flu and lived only a few hours with it. Mary O'Sullivan, Tournanough, Gneeveguilla died also. Mr and Mrs Williams of Knockanes, Headford were at a wedding and they danced all night, and got the flu, and died a few hours after.All dances were forbidden for a few months. There were no wakes held and only very near friends went to the funerals.\n",

They had neither food nor seed. Although there was sufficient corn in the country - to feed the whole population, the Government encouraged the sale of corn in order to provide the rent for the \"Masters\" - as the Landlords were called.The result was a horrible famine.

The district was thinly populated, and most of the people had oats and other crops which they used when the potatoes failed.  Those people helped them who were very poor and saved many families from starvation.There were some families who lived almost entirely on turnips and meal, given out at Kilcolman and Glin.  There was one family of the name of Sullivan, living in Park, in lower Baranigue, who were very poor.  There were three fairly elderly people in the house.  A woman and two brothers.  One day they went to the town of Newcastle West, on some business or other.At that time there was no road leading up to Carrickerry by upper Baranigue, as at present, except an old bog road or path.  People of Park, often took a short cut across the mountain or bogs across by Glensharrold, when they were going to Newcastle West.The three Sullivans took that route.  On returning, night came on them on the open mountain, between Glensharrold and Park. They were worn out from hunger and exhaustion, and it seems unable to go\n",

      "Transcription: The famine of eighteen forty six and eighteen forty seven was the greatest catastrophe in Irish history. Over a million people emigrated to England, Canada, the United States and the west India islands during that period. It is also estimated that over a million people died from the shortage of food and the sicknesses following. A university student from cambridge who was travelling the country at that time said that the country side which he passed through was completely desolated. When he did meet people they were like corpses eating in many instances the grass of the fields to keep them alive because potato crops completely failed.Before that famine the Ballyhahill district was thickly populated. Many ruins of houses can be seen where people then lived. At that time the potato crop was a complete failure. People had to go to Tarbert in those days for meal. One day as they were going to Tarbert they found a dead man on the road with grass in his mouth. It seems that he began to eat the grass and he died. They had to live on meal and turnips and nettles for a long time, and they swelled up and died.That famine was called the \"black forty-seven\". The government would not allow any ships to bring food to IReland but one steamer brok through and got food for the people.That was the first ship that brought food to Ireland during the famine times. It was a pitiable sight to see\n",

      "Transcription: Famine TimesOur grandparents never cared to speak of the Famine. There was such misery and poverty, when the potato crop failed, owing to bad wet weather in 1846-47, that they hated to talk of those dreadful days. The thought of that black period brought back such bitter memories, that they never cared to dwell much on the subject.The district around was altogether very thickly populated in those times, and some of the country roads could be likened to streets, so thick were the houses. They were notable for the fact that all of them, it might be said were built along the roadside and belonged to poor people. They were made of mud, and have crumbled to dust long since, so that no traces of them are to be seen. But old people to-day can point on the spots, where mud cabins once stood.The farmers' houses on the other hand were built of stone, and stood some distance in from the raod. In the majority of the farm houses to-day, the occupants are descended from, and are the same flesh, and blood, as those who dwelt in them in 1846. Whereas the poor people either died of the famine, or fled over the seas away from England's hard rule, and for some more genial clime.The potatoes blackened in the ground, and rotted\n",

      "Transcription: The famine of 1846 and 1847 was caused by the failure of the potato crop. Potatoes were the principal food at the time, and the people had nothing to eat but turnips. A great blight came on the potatoes around this district and all the potatoes rotted in the ground. The government gave out meal at the workhouses but the most of the people died going in for it. One man was coming from Monagea-Church and he died on the roadside and it is said that he was buried in Mulcahy's field, now where Mr Shaughnessy lives. They also gave relief schemes and the people used to do a lot of work for 2 1/2 per day. This district was very thickly populated before the famine but after about three years it was gone down to about 25. So quickly did the people die the most of them were buried uncoffined in trenches.\n",

      "Transcription: One of the saddest stories of Famine days is connected with a family that lived near Kileedy. They had no potatoes and consequently suffered from starvation and want. A terrible malady resembled fever was raging at the time. It is not known exactly what the disease was but three or four people who lived in the house got it and they all died of the disease. A few neighbours from the locality undertook the burial of them. They put hay around the corpses as it was a very contagious disease and they buried the creatures coffinless in the graves. It was impossible to get coffins at the time because there was such a demand for them.Another incident connected with the famine years in the same locality was that of a man who was exhausted from starvation, when he was given a loaf of bread. He was so exhausted that he was unable to take a bit of it and he died on the roadside from starvation and cold with the piece of bread, so long yearned for, tightly grasped in his cold lifeless hand. These are but a few of the tragic occurrences in this locality in those days.\n",

The help came and they were called \"Black and Tans\" and the reason they were called that name was because when they first came to Ireland they had no uniform so they wore the clothes of the police and the soldiers and the colours of those clothes were dark blue or black and tan, so the people called them \"Black and tans\".

Morenane is  in the present parish of Banogue which until 1861 was a part of the Parish of Croom. Adjoining Morenane is Carhue, in which in 1831, one P. Storan had a school, a small cabin in which he taught 100 catholic pupils and enjoyed a stipend of £15 per year. It is not improbable that he was of either of the families who are referred to in this note on the social conditions which prevailed here  some 100 odd years ago.)  Though there was no relationship  between them it is remarkable tha there was a dummy  in each family. The dummy in the lower family  -  that is who lived  nearest to Carhue - was one day bringing a vessel  full of stirabout on her head through the fields to where  the men were working. That was to be their dinner. She had to cross a small stream to get to the workers, and in getting over it she slipped and stumbled and the vessel full of hot stirabout tumbled down, and its contents fell into the water. The poor girl fished the stirabout from the stream-bed with her hands back into the vessel, and then proceeded on her journey.  (Mrs Moloney, Anhid  84.  The narrator heard it from her mother and thinks the incident  occurred before the famine of  '46-47.

Of course the poor people that did the spadework did not benefit much by it but those who were over seeing the work got the most of the money.The poor men who were making this old road were supposed to live through the famine at the rate of a penny a day.They were dying by the hundreds every day. They would be very glad to have turnips boiled in water for their supper or any other meal. Some of them used put a spoon of meal into a pot of water and drink it. If they chanced to get a good many turnips they would eat too much and it used nearly kill them. The road was never finished since. It is only a couple of 100 yards long.\n",

The food they had instead was turnips and marigolds but these were very scarce and the poor people used to go from all this district to buy them at two or three pence per stone.

It was tossed about in mid ocean for a long time and at last the supply of food ran short. There was no ship in sight and they had lost all hope. The only chance of saving the passengers from starvation was that one of their number should be killed for food. They agreed to draw lots from a box. The first name drawn was that of a married man who had a wife and family with him. They thought it was not right to take the life of a father so they decided to draw again. The second time it was a married man also. At length they decided that the Cabin Boy should be the victim. He\n",

There was one sort of potatoes that did not fail. These potatoes were called \"the Reills\". The people that had not these potatoes used to dig every second one on those who had them. People say that the fields used to be black with people picking presaugh.

Ireland was thickly populated at that time there were eight and a half million people in it while now there is only the half of that four and a quarter million people. Most of the people had to eat potatoes and buttermilk. The Irish husbandman had to go to his work barefoot and covered with rags. His ruinous hovel covered with weeds. He was seated at a table sharing with his family his dry and scanty meal. His payment was usually sixpence halfpenny a day. They had only an acre of ground and they had potatoes sown in half o it and corn in the other half which they had to sell the corn to pay the rent.They then depended on the potato crop, but the potatoes took the blight and they decayed in the ground. The people nearly starved and they took diseases and most of the people died. They died in the fields, on the roadsides and in the towns. They even shut the doors of their houses and whole families died. They were not even put in a grave or a coffin. When the English saw the people dying they were very glad, because they thought they could get Ireland all for themselves. Then they gave employment in every parish and this made an improvement. Some of the people went out to America and they died in the ships and they were thrown out into the ocean for the sharks and other kinds of fish to eat them and they had a watery gravy.

Peg was just after coming from Nenagh when the peeler arrived.When Peg saw him she took off her coat and laid in on the Porter, knelt on it and started \"Holy Mary Mother of God,\" and so on for three times.  The peeler fell into a hen roost and by the time he was free (out) Peg had the liquor hidden, and when he asked her why she did not answer him she said \"I was speaking to a better man\".\n",

Others died by the ditch and in old houses and in several cases they were eaten by rats and dogs. The Government of the day looked on callous. They said that it was the easiest way to exterminate the Irish race. It was said that it was a vengance from God that the famine came because the people treated the food badly the previous years. The potatoes were so plentiful that the people healed them up in carts against the ditch and did not cover them from the frost or snow. The famine continued for almost five years.Some humane British having heard of the sad plight of the poorer Irish decided on starting public works and building soup schools where food was distributed. The real poorer class were given course Indian meal which was made into sturabout and eaten with water and in some cases milk.The next thing that started was a plague which was a dreadful disease. People died like flies by the roadside. Some people were buried immediately after death and otehrs were not buried for often a week after death. Several people were buried coffinless. The\n",

This particular evening she kept the meal for the morning meal and went out to a garden belonging to a farmer near and she got some turnip leaves that were thrown waste and some nettles and she boiled them for the evening meal. During the night a flood came - she was living in a boggy district - and swept away the meal.This illustrates the proverb \"Don't keep the night's share for the morning\"Nettles , prussack wee (praireach buidhe) and water cress were largely used during the famines.\n",

He closed the box again and when night came he  went to bed and about twelve o'clock he heard a noise and woke up.He saw a white cloth over the box but soon the white cloth was gone. When the day came he opened the box again and took one of the apples to eat but found it was a stone and he got frightened. In two minutes two men came out of the box, gave him a good beating, and nearly killed him.

There was a hospital for those people  who suffered with cholera. They used to die so quickly that coffins could not be kept made. My grandfather used to tell us that some people were buried half-alive. The ruins of this hospital are to be seen near Abbey Street. It is now called the \"Old Hospital\".There were many \"Relief Houses\" round Roscrea.  There was one on the Templemore Road. The people used to get tickets, and when they presented the ticket at the \"Relief House\" they used to get yellow meal. Many of the bye roads in this locality were made as relief schemes.The O'Meaghers of Clonan\n",

It started in 1845.From 1845 to 1846 it was bad enough but then came the second year \"the black forty seven\" which was twice as bad as as the first.I heard a story told once in connection with the famine: In thistown of Roscrea there is a Sacred Heart Convent. It has been here for many years back. Years and years ago, long before the famine, the nuns in this convent were very kind to the poorand they used to give out parcels of meatand bread and all kinds of food. These they would put in a barrel and leave inside the convent door for any poor person that might come. At first a few poor people used to come. But then they began to increase yey everybody got something.But, alas, when the famine came people began coming in thousands to them . The nuns then had not enough\n",

Then Delaney said \"I beg your honours pardon, in what I'm going to say, I think you are mistaken and entirely led astray\". Then Ely upbraided him for saying such and told him he would have to banish his son. Delaney went home and told his son - James what had happened.On a November night 18th century James Delaney left his father's house and proceeded to a style near Ely's house over which Ely would have to go when he would be going home. When he was leaving he took with him a cap belonging to his younger brother. Besides this he had a potato basket in which he stood, it is said to save his footprints being seen. He lay in this while waiting for Ely. At midnight Ely came along going to his home - Ballaghmore Castle (to be seen at present on the main Roscrea - Dublin Road). Delaney waited until Ely got up on the style and then shot him. He fired two shots in succession but he did not kill him outright. As he left he lost the cap. Someone came along before Ely died and Ely told told him that it was either Talbot or Delaney shot him. He immediately went to the police and the police set out in search of the murderer. They first went to Talbot's house and found him in bed. They then proceeded to Delaney's house. One of the police was dangling the cap, which they found near the body, in his hand and Delaney's young brother when he saw the cap cried out \"O there's my cap\".

Much valuable information has gone with them. It did not affect this district as much as others. But the district was very thickly populated before the famine. The decline in population was chiefly due to emigration in the subsequent years.Great numbers of ruins and sites of houses can still be seen throughout the parish. Spring wells are also numerous indicating that there were dwellings nearby. Other indications are boreens or as they are called in this parish \"bosheens\" also names of fields eg Coyne's field in Jessfield, Kavanagh's field in Tinnock  Casse's field.The blight came suddenly and the potatoes decayed in the ground, and in some cases in the pits. The old people used to point out that  it was a malediction on the people for the waste of the previous year. Potatoes were so plentiful that they were left in the ground to rot. In order to have seed potatoes for the following year they cut out the part containing the \"eye\" and kept the remainder for food. In ridges potatoes were generally sown.

Before that time the locality was very thickly populated, the village of Clerihan being a very large place at that time and having a large population.The whole village is now, more or less, in ruins, the remains of the houses are still to be seen.The stalks of the potatoes became black and decayed. The potatoes were small and scarce under the stalks. The principal decay came during the Winter in the pits. When those were opened the following Spring, all the potatoes were found to have rotted and gone black. The people had to use yellow meal instead. There were relief houses in every district, one being in the village of Clerihan. Each man used to get 1 lb of yellow meal per day. There is a story told that the people were dissatisfied with the allowance and asked for more. One man was picked to see how much he could eat, and he ate 2 lbs of meal and 1/- month of bread and still had not enough. After that incident the ration was increased to 2 lbs of meal per day.It is said that people were got dead in the dykes with a green slime around their mouths, showing that they were trying to eat grass before death. Great numbers were buried coffinless.Up to 60 or 70 years ago, the food given to the labourers was yellow meal for breakfast, and potatoes for dinner and supper. The farmers' houses in which the porridge used to be made fairly thick are still spoken of, as this was thought to be a grand concession.\n",

      "Transcription: Before the famine the potato became the chief food for the people of Emly. In 1844 they were very plentiful. The people had no regard for them. They had so much of them that they did not dig them. They left them in the ridges in some places.In 1845 the potatoes rotted in the ground. In 1846 they rotted again. The people dug gardens in peculiar places, such as the top of a hill to try and make them appear. But it did no good - they failed again.Most of the farmers were not badly off during the famine. They had some food. It was the poor people that suffered; because potatoes & milk were their only food. They ate raw turnips and weeds boiled with salt. They got a disease, called cholera, from the food. Really, in this place, it was after the famine most died.The story is told that one man who was hungry for a couple of days got a good dinner. He was dead the day after. That happened in a few cases where a hungry man got food. He ate too much & he died suddenly.In 1847 yellow meal was given out. Each person got one lb. per day. Some people got work on the roads also, and so got a little money.A great deal of people emigrated. They left their farms when the landlords gave them what took them to america. That is the cause of so much ranch land in this parish. The people got a price of a ticket to america & they left. Some of them died on the ship; because they took the cholera with them.The growing men of this parish walked to Limerick and joined the British army. They got many fine men during the famine - and hardly any one of them ever came back to Emly again.\n",

The corn in Ireland of the previous year was an abundant one and there was a great number of Cattle, Sheep and Swine here also. But the farmers had to export most of these to England to get money to pay their rents to the Landlord lest they might be evicted. It none was exported there would be enough to support the whole population of Ireland for the year. it was a famine in the midst of plenty. The following year 1847 known ad \"Black 47\" the disease showed itself in a more virulent form. It destroyed over a million and a half of corn.

The population of Ireland at that time was nine millions, but it is only half that at present.The people died like flies by the hedges and ditches.  About one million died of hunger and a million emigrated to America.Without the potatoes the Irish people had plenty wheat to support themselves but they had to export it to England.  Corn was sent from America to the aid of the starving Irish but the English used to sink the ships in the ports.In the townland of Montrice in the parish of Truagh, Barony of Lower Tulla, Co. Clare, where one family now resides, it was formerly occupied by thirty two families.  Then the government gave a grant to be expended on public works.  The men worked for 4s a day, the women for 2s and the little boys for 1s. They also distributed free meal to the starving people.On one occasion a man died of hunger coming down to Broadford for the free meal.  They also gave employment by making high fences.

About twenty years ago the O'Meara's and the servant boy went to the island to bring home cattle and sheep which they were to sell at the fair.  The O'Meara man got into the boat with the cattle while his brother and the servant boy went in a different boat.  The day was rough and the cattle were uncomfortable.  They swayed to one side and the boat overturned.  The cattle swam safely but the man got drowned.  The island is known since as O'Meara's island.  The brother lives there yet.\n",

The Irish people in those years unfortunately left themselves dependent for food upon the potatoe crop and the result of the potatoe failure was great starvation among them.About one million people died of hunger or of disease caused by hunger in those famine years, and about one million is supposed to have emigrated to the United State and other countries to escape death from hunger at home.Work-houses were built for the poor people who had not enough money to pay for food. Mrs. O'Callaghan of Raheen was a matron in the Work-house in Scariff. My mother told me that her mother Mrs. Scott was born the last year of the famine.Some of the people who had no food used to eat raw turnips and seaweed. The people died so quickly the they were buried coffinless and they were often found dead on the roadside.In 1921 in order to prevent the Black-and-Tans from staying in the Work-house in Scariff they removed the patients and burned the Workhouse.\n",

The blight came on the potatoes when they were growing and this lessened the quantity a great deal.

When the following spring came the people had no seeds to plant except the decayed ones. In these times the population was double what it is now. It was estimated to be over eight millions. The disaster in a thickly populated country was something terrible. Many people are said to have died of hunger or of a disease caused by the starvation. Of course it is a true word to say that many emigrated to foreign countries to escape the hunger. In the years of the famine the hunger-stricken and fever-stricken people not only died in their own houses but in the fields, on the road sides and by ditches.

      "Transcription: In the days of our grandfathers the potato was a very important food and it on it the people depended for food as they had very little wheat and flour.  It happened one year that a change came upon the potato stalk when it was nearly fully grown.  This change caused teh stalk which was always a green colour to turn brown as if it were burned and it decayed.  This caused the potato to rot and so started off the famine.  As the farmers never saw this disease before they knew no remedy to cure it.  Scarcety of food set in and poverty and starvation stared the people in the face.  Soon people began to die of hunger as their supply of food was used.  People got sick and fever and many other diseases broke out and spread through the country.  People were dying of hunger in hundreds as the government was able to give very little assistance.  Brendan Walle 3rd/8/1938Teller Lot Malone\n",

Next they would put one [?] on the centre, and one under the sod at both sides. There was a street of house on the road I come to school and they all died of Cholera in the famine year.

He seemed to be a rather foolish or abnormal type of individual  about 18 years of age. The local volunteers discovered him and naturally concluded that he had been sent into the  district as a spy. They arrested him and  held a council as to what should be done with him. As the soldier  seemed to be unable to give any reasonable  account of his movements or objects the majority of the  council were in favour of having the prisoner shot  -   Séamus Ó Seasnáin, Ceathrú an t-Séadáin\n",

They lit fires on the hills, especially on the Blackhill, in order that vessels may come near the shore and then be wrecked and looted. One night a ship was sailing around Hag's Head and a bonfire was lighting on the Black Hill. As the Captain of the ship had heard about this practice he ordered his gunners to fire a cannon ball towards the fire. This cannon ball struck an old ruin near the hill, and rebounded down the hill - side. It was picked up and is now to be seen at Howard's in Rineen.\n",

The widow worked in a big house and so she was given what food was left over to feed herself and her two boys. One time the boys were left for three days without any food so on the evening of the fourth day they were eagerly awaiting for their mother's return. They were both staggering with hunger. They stood on the doorsteps watching for her. At last she came and to their dismay had no food so the two little innocents died of hunger in their mothers presence.\n",

Then owing to the shortage of food the government distributed meals through local agents. In some cases next was starvation and it was recorded that a man travelled thirty miles to Kilrush and was in such a pitiable state that he put his hand into a large boiler in which turnips were boiled to get a turnip to eat having scalded his hands. There was an epidemic of cholera and the people died in large numbers. There was a case of a man in Kilrush who was buried when he kicked at the cover of his coffin.

There were twice as many people in this district before the famine as there are at the present day.In the end of Summer in the year eighteen forty six the blight came on the potatoes when the stalks were green and in full bloom. The people did not know what it was, because they never before saw it and they knew no way of preventing it from spreading. It destroyed most of the potatoes in the year eighteen forty six and that left the people in  a bad way. But when it destroyed the crops the next year the people had nothing to fall back on. So they had to gather the small potatoes\n",

Their pay was three-halfpence a day and some got a little bag of meal. More people went to their potato fields and dug out some of the black potatoes to eat them. If they did not eat some of the potatoes they would starve. All this happened in the \"black forty seven\" as the old man said.Many of the houses which went to ruin in the famine times were rebuilt and many people are living in them now.The blight on the potato-crop came just as it comes now but came very much heavier.

Whatever was their destination no one knows for they have never since been heard of.The blight came on the potatoes in 1846 and as the bulk of the people had learned to depend on potatoes as their staple food the scarcity caused by the blight proved to be a great privation.

It lasted for three years they were 1847, 1848, 1849. It was said the year before then, the potatoes were a very heavy crop. The people though very little of them. In 1847 the spuds went black and the people dug the fields three times looking for some little ones that could be eaten. There was a great scarcity of flour, and Indian meal, and it cost a half-crown a stone. It had to be used for making bread. During that time, there was a big boiler put up at Dundalk and the people boiled Indian meal in it. All the people came to the boiled with a spoon and the people who owned it gave them their spoonful and they would go home.\n",

One morning when the people came to it they were astonished to find that the well was gone & had been moved to a field further away and also the tree that had grown beside it was moved. This was to show the people how careful they should be of a holy well It was called the Well of the Candlesticks\n",

Hundreds of people passed every day on foot on their way to Drogheda. At that time the grandfather of the McCullen's of Beamore was working for Mr Smith of Beamore. His occupation was doing sentry in a field of turnips. He walked across the headland with a gun all day if any poor starving people came to steal the turnips. Mr McCullen knew that his occupation would not last long and he thought there was no harm in giving a few turnips to the starving people. When the people came to steal the turnips he told them not to take those nearest the end of the field but to go far into the field where they would not be missed. In this way Mr Smith never found out that his sentry was disobeying him.\n",

She told Mrs. Conway (Ballivor) that she remembered when there was a soup kitchen in Ballivor where the Court is held now (Mr Patk. McGearty's) She also remembered that the poor people used to get leave from the big farmers to dig over the fields from which  the potatoes had already been dug for any that were left in the ground. She herself did this as a girl. There were so many poor that each only got a section of a field.The relief works started at the end of the Famine included the sinking of the Boyne. Old Frank Glennon of Glack, Ballivor was a kind of foreman of the workers. It was very cold weather and they had to get in to the deep water to do the work. They were standing on the bank afraid to face it, and Glennon said to them \"Come on- we may as well die this way as die of starvation\".  (His daughter-in-law, Mrs Glennon, and her family still live in Glack)Rathkeenan Bridge on the Stoneyford is dated 1848, and there are several roads called \"The New Line\".\n",

On meeting the Reverence, Mr. Rothwell challenged him and pointed out, he would not allow him to continue on his way. The priest persisted and as Mr. Rothwell refused to leave his path he politely told him to stand where he was.

For the purpose of administering the Act the Guardians were empowered to make and levy a rate over the Union area. To understand the meaning of the term relief in a workhouse, it is well to indicate the kind of institution a workhouse was.Kells Workhouse was erected in 1841 was much on the same plan as the majority of such buildings.

Owing to heavy rain the bogs were flooded and so there was no fuel for fires.There are many stories told of the hardships endured.

In this district, Stackallen, the relief works that were started were lowering the steep hills of the roads and filling the hollows. There were three hills lowered in this district, in Faganstown, Shalvenstown and Gernonstown. The work lasted for two years. The wages the men got was ten pence a day. The price of a stone of indian meal in the shops was 2/8/1/2 so that a man could not get two stone for his weeks wages. The men were so exhausted that a number of them died at their work. One man died working at Faganstown from the effects of hunger and another man died at Gernonstown from the same cause.

The person belonged to the \"Fetherston Haugh\" or as they are locally called Fetherston family of Brocklyn and also of Rockview.  These family residences are about one mile apart but the estates which comprise some thousands of acres are and were imposing land marks in Westmeath.Some years ago it was an offence for any person to walk across any of the Fetherston Estate.  It happened that some one of the servants got ill and the priest was crossing the field towards Dardestown where the patient was ill to attend the sick person.It is said the priest was prevented from crossing the land by Fetherston who said \"If the sick person died and went to hell\" he would not let the priest attend to him.The Priest told Fetherston the day would come when one of the Fetherston's names would would not claim a scrap of the land on which they stood.  At the present date 1937 the Fetherston estates have changed their names.  The heir to Brocklyn estate was killed at a railway crossing some years ago and the heir to Rockview was never traced since he went out to the European War in 1914.\n",

There was a meeting held in the church at eleven o'clock and the people had just gone out after the meeting when the steeple fell. Mrs Payne was standing at her door looking at the door and she saw something falling in the church yard. She knew it was the steeple of the church. Eight feet of it fell and some of it fell outside and part inside and broke the organ which was never any use again. The people had all to give money to get the new steeple and organ which we have now.\n",

It was a great pity we had not this meeting in the beginning of the year as we would then have known better how to proceed with this work. However he assured us that the object of this book is to collect \"Folk lore\" & that so long as the book is filled with true facts of either present or past it doesn't really matter if the work here is not all done by the children.The pupils here, about 50% of them are orphan girls living in seclusion and they have little chance of meeting with people who can give them much information about the country or people. I therefore their teacher, will write in this book anything of interest I can find out.\n",

In her absence a poor boy came to the door. begging something to eat. He was starving with the hunger not having tasted food for days. Generous kind hearted Joe gave the starving boy a nice hot square of the oaten cake, and just as he did his mother returned.In those days the water was carried in a wooden pail which was made by the cooper and was carried on the head.The timid boy overjoyed with his meal jumped when he heard the step and had the misfortune to knock Mrs. Delaney and the pail flat on the ground.

The people unfortunately left themselves dependent upon the potato crop for food and the result of the failure of this crop was starvation among the people. The population in this district was then almost double what it is now. About two thousand people are estimated to have died of hunger or of disease as result of the Famine, while many more sailed in emigrant ships to Canada, the United States and Scotland to escape death from hunger at home. In those dread Famine years the hunger-stricken and fever-stricken people died not only in their houses, but on the roads, in the fields and in the ditches. Very many unable to pay the rent which the Landlords demanded were thrown out of their homes to perish and die by the wayside.

People were given land in exchange for a stone of oatmeal. Some families were extremely poor when a death took place, the corpse was carried on shoulders to the graveyard during the night. People died like flies from hunger, Coffins were rough and home-made. No such practice as rambling or gambling as people were not able to walk with weakness.The porridge made in a big boiler in the protestant ministers yards at Doon.

He demanded an interview with the lord.Tormey asked him did he know the people who were about to be evicted in Moate.  The lord said he did not but that his agent did.  Well said Tormey \"I am Private Owen Tormey of the Connaught Rangers that climbed the heights of Alma when you ran away and I warn you not to bring me here again .\"His lordship was very frightened when Tormey produced a revolver.

      "Transcription: There was a house in the townsland of Newgrove parish of Drumraney and county of Westmeath. This house was owned by a family called the Bannons. These people lived in the time of the famine. Some of these people died of hunger and more of them went to America. The reason they died of hunger was, because on account of the failure of the potatoes. The place where the potatoes failed was in the pits. When the next year came the people had no potatoes to sow and the government gave the potatoes out free and the year after the people had to pay it back in the rates.\n",

It was a large ship and very modern at the time. People who were rich and who could afford to pay their passage looked forward with great excitement to the maiden voyage of this great vessel for which she was completely booked. She left Southhampton and from the time of her departure until she met with her awful fate everyone on board was in great spirits. There were (some) amusements of every kind including a tennis-court, on this ship.We learn from survivors of this vessel that there was no depression. The commander of this ship was warned by a passing vessel of the oncoming danger. But being fearless of anything tragic occurring took no notice of the warning. In mid Atlantic she was struck by an iceberg and went headlong to her doom. There were some survivors but the majority of the people including millionaires were drowned. The passengers and the crew who remained on the vessel sang to the music of the band playing, “Nearer, my God to Thee” and they went down with the ill-fated Titanic.\n",

The poor people used to leave the houses rather than see their children die of hunger.Some Wheaten meal was sent from England to them but it was sent too late and when the people would go to buy some of it, it would be all sold.It affected our district too but not many people died of hunger. The cattle and sheep died too. About one million people died in Munster alone. The people of England treated the Irish people very badly.The people of Great Britain gave large sums of money to help the Irish people to buy food.

Of course Kinsealy was a farming district, and the people had no other food; so the had to depend on the potatoes. About one hundred died of hunger, and another hundred were emmigrated to America and other countries.In these dread famine days a lot of people died in the wood ditch running along the Malahide Road. More died in the Castle wood. All the mud houses that were thrown in the past few years is the past result of the famine. The people were not able to rent and were thrown out on the road to starve. Another thing was - anyone found out of their house between sunrise and sun-set, were liable to fourteen years transportation beyond the seas.The people were so famine-stricken around Kinsealy that one could see them eating grass. They drew blood of cattle and drank it. They killed the little donkeys, that served them years on their little farms.When the little ships left Malahide and Baldoyle with dying passengers on board, they were thrown overboard. These ships were called coffin ships, Many of these  people's bones lie in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the U,S,A.William Redmond.No 7 Kinsealy Lane,Malahide,Co Dublin.\n",

He was then tied to a stake and three men whipped him for 15 minutes.When he hung loosely on the ropes he was cut loose, and was let fall to the ground.He was unconscious for some time, and when he got better, he found out that he couldn't walk, from loss of blood.

They were so scarce they could not afford to eat them and a plan was thought of that they should cut they eye out of the potatoe and sow it. Then they could eat the remainder.

This meant that the men had to leave home at 3 o clock in the morning, and walk to work and return in the same way, reaching home at about nine o clock.  They took their supper of Indian meal and went to bed, while the women folk remained up to prepare the Indian meal for the morning and call them in time.  Down in the townsland of Annaghharvey in the parish one day a group of men were working in the drains under a ganger called Colgan.  This Colgan wasn't a bad fellow and had compassion for the men. Tarleton, friend of Thompsons, was passing by riding on a white horse.  He stopped to look at the work and while there a man came up out of a drain, staggered around and fell in a faint.  Tarleton remarked to Colgan that that was a queer man to have employed.  Colgan replied it was the result of hunger and hardship,\n",

Its end is to the road and it faces South East. This house did not belong to the Flatterys. Peter's mother owned it, His grandmother Mary Byrne had the lease of it and the little farm rolled round a stick and a piece of cloth sewed round it. It was 300 years old and he remembers it stuck in the roof but it got lost when he was getting the new roof on. He doesn't know at all what happened it.

My grandmother who was born in the Parish of Donaghmore Co Limerick in the years 1812 used to relate many incidents of those terrible times, but I was too young to retain most of them.  She used to say that many a fine man and woman whom she knew died of starvation.  One morning as she was going early to Limerick she saw a man dead by the roadside.  This was only one of the tales she could tell.In her parish about 30 died similarly.  Others struggle on like skeletons eating every class of food the could lay hands on, i.e. turnips, crabs, even herbs.  When any person died and had to be taken a long distance to be buried, she used to say that those who used to shoulder the remains often fell with weakness from hunger.  Strange to relate as she often said that the crops of potatoes which grew previous to this famine were remarkably plentiful and therefore people had not thought enough of them, and in cases they were stated to be only in the way, as they grew up among corn and hay.  But people should thank God for plenty and thank him for everything.I got this from my father Patrick Fitzgerald, Belmont, Offaly.  Written by James Fitzgerald (same address)\n",

My great grand father had the seed potatoes and fearing they would be taken for food he hid them in the turf clamps.  Putting the turf securley outside. When the potatoes were fairly well grown they had to be guarded at night time.  As there was no food in the district at the time and only the Govenment gae out indian meal which was made into porridge twice a week and given out at Mr Acres house at Ballybeg. when the potatoe crop failed they became bad for food and fever followed people died in great numbers and that year has been remembered since as black 47.  There are no sites of houses remaining but several fields bear the names of their former owners. Such as Prollicks field, Sheeshans [?] field Tynans field and other. Oat meal was used by any people fortunate to have it with new milk and sometimes buttermilk.  It has  been related in the district that a man worked for three days without food and able bodied young men volunteered to walk from Shinrone a distance of four miles to mow all day if they could be afforded a meal\n",

      "Transcription: An Old StoryAbout fifty years ago there lived in Ballaghmore an extensive farmer named Delaney. He had one wild son who was very fond of shooting.  At that time it was a serious crime for a middle class farmer to carry fire arms.  On one occasion when the father when to pay his rent to the landlord he refused to take it on the grounds that he allowed his son with dog and gun the shooting of the game.  The old man doubted the story and the land lord gave his author as George Ely the agent.  The agreement came to between them was to have the dog shot and the gun forfeited.  When young James heard this he made a resolution to shoot Ely.  He lay in wait and shot him on his rounds.  Of course there was no doubting it was he fired the fatal shot and the townland was surrounded with soldiers and policemen. The local Catholic Clergy meanwhile condemming the murder said that James Delaney would be in their midst and a sight of him they would never see.  He made some hair breadth escapes but was never caught, he died a few years ago at an advanced age.  There are some nice poems composed about him as he was considered a hero by some and a criminal by others.\n",

There was every kind of dirt mixed through it, and the people took diseases from it and died. There was one house in Ballagmmore and another in Glasshouse. At that time there was a priest in Shinrone named Father Martin Kennedy who did a great lot for the people, anything he had he gave it to them.

One states that it was so called because it was a terrible climb for horses in olden times.  The road at one time was just on a level with the high path (8 feet over the road) but a great deal of it was removed, and this stuff was deposited in the \"Callows\", which lie at the back of it.  There is a gateway here by the high path and on the keystone of the arch is cut the name of Thomas Smith and a date which is not clear.  It is said that the mail-coach was once robbed here, and that when the culprit was caught he was hanged here.Others say that this place got it's name from the Gallows which Colonel Oxburgh caused to be erected there in 1689 when he was appointed Provost Marshall of Kings. Co.  He showed his authority by riding through the county in great state and caused gallows to be erected at several places. Amongst them he had one at Birr on this spot.

From John Delaney, Clonin, Age 80 years,  who said it was written by Danny Dowling, Castletown, * Blackbird was a nickname.No more in Gashin's  furze you'll hear.The huntsman's horn soundNo more in Wistfield's hills and valesThey run the fox to ground.On Forest's verdant slope you'll hear,The tally-ho no more.And sweet Kilowen is silent now,And so is Derryfore.The echo of the beagles yells.Shall never be heard alas!Reverted thro' the windy dells;Of beateaus Clontyglass.The black-bird on his mountain perchMay sit and sigh all day,While Reynard sleeps quite tranquillyAnd the huntsmen are at bay.\n",

      "Transcription: Sir George Whitford lived at Mount Salena in the four-storeyed house now occupied by Mr.Casey. He was an uncle of George Whitford of Derrynesara. He bought Mount Salena from the Trenches of Heywood and became landlord of a large demense belonging to it. He also had a house in Merrion Sq,Dublin and was at one time Lord Mayor of Dublin. It was during that time he received the Knighthood, when George IV came over to open the bridge over the Liffey known as the \"King's Bridge\" the Lord Mayor met him coming off the boat, kneeling down and laying his robe on the ground for the king to walk over. The King inquired who he was \"George Whitford my leige\" said the Mayor,the king drew his sword and laying it on Whitford's  head said \"arise Sir Geo. Whitford\".Whitford intended building a large court in the field opposite where Gibburn's live but shortly after the foundation were laid his wife died and soon afterwards his daughter so the work was abondoned. At one time a stone wall ran from Mt Salena gate to Tinnakill cross (Fitzpatrick's) It was known as Whitford's Demense wall, the remains of it are only to be seen in places now. A large triangular field surrounded by roads is still known as \"The Colony \"from the number of people- about 50 families evicted off it by Whitford. Sir George died in 1865 and is buried in Annatrim under a flat tomb together with his wife and only daughter.\n",

This action being then illegal, these men were told by the priest to go out on the appointed night between the hours of twelve and one and nothing would happen them. My grandfather being appointed for the district of Granstown, went out and placed his poster in position. Returning home, at a lonely spot on the road a great noise stated suddenly, just a few yards behind him, resembling the noise of a cart being driven very fast, he also heard the quick pounding of hoses' hooves on the road. At the same time a man was shouting to him to keep out of the way. This noise followed him for a quarter of a mile to where a river crossed the road. The noise stopping suddenly, my grandfather looked back and although the night was very bright he could not see anything. A great fear then came upon him and the sweat trickled down all over him. He managed to get home, and after a rest he was nothing the worse of his adventure.\n",

The woman had yellow meal stir-a-bout prepared for the dinner.  She went to the door and called out \"Come in boys\".  One of the sons went in quickly, and he was so hungry that he had all the food eaten when the others came in.  The boy who had eaten all the food died shortly afterwards.The following was also told by her:-A farmer living near Grantstown had a large field of turnips.

All the people would have starved only for a Spanish ship coming with a load of \"Indian meal\". There is the site of an old house near Dollard's house Cullohill which was occupied in that time but is now in ruins. There is another site near Collier's house Ballyhealy which was occupied then.There was no spraying done that year and so all the potatoes rotted. Nearly all the potatoes decayed and there was very few seed for the next year. The year of the famine the people went to the priest and asked him what they should do. He told them to sow the snags. They sowed them and they grew. The next year the people had potatoes but some sowed the snags and they did not grow.The people ate turnips and mangolds when they had no potatoes. Most? of the people of this district died of starvation and hunger. A great fever followed the hunger and more people died.\n",

These troops placed the Catholics in new occupation of the Abbey from which they had been previously driven. There stay was of short duration for in April (1650) they were again obliged to fly from the relentless Cromwell. It is a firmly believed tradition in Callan that when Cromwell assaulted the place, the priest was on the chief altar in the choir engaged in the celebration of mass, which he continued to the end, and that the choir in which he officiated remained unharmed, though the roofs of the nave and aisle to the rere were smashed down from the fire of the batteries. The tradition got the more credence from the fact that the aisles were to be seen roofless and in ruins whilst the choir remained in perfect preservation until (1850).\n",

There was a ford across the Barrow at this point and the castle was built to defend the ford. A canal weir was constructed on the river near the castle in 1760, and the walls of the castle were demolished to provide material to build the weir. Thus there are only portions of two walls of the castle standing.Tinnehinch Castle:-The word Tinnehinch probably means \"the house of the Island or River Meadown\". To-day Tinnehinch is a little village on the Carlow side of the river Barrow opposite Graignamanagh on the Kilkenny side. One house there is called the \"hotel\" for such it was in the days of the Bianconi Stage Couches. The Castle of Tinnehinch was built by the Butlers in the 16th century to protect a ford across the Barrow. It is a strong, square, two-storey structure, the ruins of which have been admirably preseved. Butler was a man of fierce temper. He is supposed to have drowned a number of people, whom he invited to a banquet, in the castle, and because of this atrocity rain falls every day on which fairs or markets are held in Graignamanagh.\n",

The people did not know what to do with them and they threw them out in the ditches. When the blight came the people did not know what it was. The potato stalks were burned to the clay. The potatoes turned black on top. The amount of good potatoes they had were kept being afraid to sow them lest the blight should come again. They did not sow any potatoes for a couple years afterwards.At that time the potatoes were sown in ridges in grass fields. The ridge was the length of the field and about six feet in breradth. These were six sods ploughed with a single plough drawn with one horse. the manure they used was grass sods that had been burnt. They used cut the sods pile them and leave them to wither and dry.The poor people got Indian meal from the government. They did not know how to cook it.

A failure of the potato crop was the cause of it.  Before that time the potatoes were the only food that the people had.  The poor people were starving for food and had no money to buy it.  The farmers had plenty of food and money but they would not give any to the poor people.  After a time the farmers gave them work and they earned a little money.  Then they bought meal and made porridge.  The southern and western counties suffered more than any other.  Some people went through the fields gathering weeds and boiled them to eat.

The people around the district usually lived on potatoes until the blight came in 1845.  There is only about one - sixth of the population in the County Wexford now as were in it before the famine.  The blight spread quickly and after a while the whole crop failed.  The people used go out through the fields and gather the wild weeds and eat them.  Many died of disease.  They also used to eat raw turnips.  The people were watching with anxious hope for the new crop but it failed.   When the mothers returned with their little bags on their backs the children were delighted.  The people can point out to-day the houses in which the people lived during the famine.  After the famine a great sickness came called famine fever and many died from this fever.  In 1847 the potato crop failed all over the district.  All the roads were thronged with dead and dying.  All the corn was sent out of the country and the cattle were sent to England and other countries.The potatoes rotted in the grounds and some in the pits.  But at last the government began to give relief measures.There was money sent from America and other countries.  The people were very grateful for this.

The majority of the Irish people were very poor, and their chief food was potatoes. The corn crop of this year was an abundant one, but still the people could not keep it because they had to sell it to get money to pay their rents. The blight caused the potatoes to blacken and become unfit for use. Some of the people put the potatoes in pits hoping in this way to save them but it was of no use.

In the course of the afternoon the vessel appeared some distance from Wicklow she was without sails or masts and there was no sign of anyone on board, having passed Wicklow and the storm still raging and night coming on, those on board decided to make one desparate effort launched their small boat near Britis Bay but they all got swamped.

He had a wife and one daughter, who was as beautiful and good as her father was ugly and grasping. There was a nobleman living near who had a son who was brave and handsome, and poor. The boy and girl were in love with each other and used to meet secretly, but one day the old miser found this out and locked the girl in her room.The boy heard this, and came to try and rescue her away and marry herHe planned it all out in his mind beforehand, and one dark night he stole into the castle through a window, intending to lock the doors of the miser's and his wife's sleeping\n",

On the southern slope of the hill was an old ash tree on the hedge of a field adjoining the house at present owned by Mr. Mc. Enery. It was from one of the old boughs of this tree that the hangman's rope was suspended. Underneath this tree was a very deep hole or well about five feet wide into which the unfortunate victims were thrown.About 200 yards from this tree, in the same field adjoing adjoining the old main road was an old jail in which the prisoners were kept for some time before being brought to the gallows. Though this jail was about eleven yards wide and fifteen yards long there are only two parts of the walls are left. The other parts are almost invisible being entirely overgrown with moss forming little banks which indicate the shape of the building. This jail may have been built a long time as the material used in it is like that of the castle and can scarcely be broken up.\n",

They would have to dig from morning till night to get as many as would do their dinner.It was in that year the Indian meal came to Ireland and the people were only allowed a certain quantity of it.Hundreds of people were sent on the emigration ships to America and Australia. The workhouses were filled also. These were small houses built here and there through the country and people used gather into them for their supper and breakfast of Indian porridge, which a local man had charge over, to see that everyone got a little. The following year the Government gave a small amount of Champion potatoes to every farmer to start a new crop.\n",

This caused great disturbance in the country and consequently the police were sent for to find out who shot him and the final was that men were imprisoned for nine months and they were not guilty. Amongst these was James Brennan my uncle.The most terrific storm that has ever been was the storm of '98. All the people were so frightened that they were  praying by the road-side.

A story was told that when three men went out for a day's digging they would only get a small can full. Some potatoes were kept for the following year and others had none for seed. The people ate porridge while they had it, when it was done they ate dandelion sorrel and any roots they could gather in the fields and hedges. blackberries and other wild berries were also eaten. The potatoes were sown in ridges. There is a road leading from the main road to Listraor bog called the twopenny road because it was part of the relief work given during the famine time the workers being paid 2d per day.There is no account of any person dying of starvation.

It was Sir W. Power, who was an engineer & paymaster in the British army, who superintended the making of the River or Drain. He was a native of Tyrone & he married Dr. Moor's daughter of Annagh ma-Kerrig & that's how that place came to belong to him. The making of the river was relief work. It was made between 80 & 90 years ago.Those times were called \"the bad times\". If you had a cow you'd get no relief work. Ned Mc Kenna Cordoo Newbliss who died recently and was over 90 years of age says that men got relief work then, making roads. They got 2D per day & if they brought a barrow they got 6D per day.David Wales of Crappagh says his father was then working for a lady named Mrs. Moore, near Rockcorry.

The government had men employed there making thin porridge which the peasants carried home in tin cans. Each peasant was allowed a quantity in ratio to the family which he or she had to support. This porridge was not half boiled and when the peasants came home they re-boiled it which then thickened up, and far more sustaining  for their hunger pangs.\n",

In eighteen forty five there was a partial failure of the potato crop. On that account the famine was not so severe in eighteen forty six there was a total failure of the potato crop and the real pinch of the famine was in eighteen forty seven. The stalks of the potatoes withered before the potatoes matured, and subsequently they decayed in the ground. In this locality owing to its distance from the big towns little of the grain was exported. In consequence the famine was not so severe because the people had the grain to fall back on. And though they had hardly enough to eat there was sufficient to sustain life. As a result very few died from famine.In eighteen forty seven a number of people from far-off places like flocked to the district on the verge of starvation, some of them almost dying.There is a story told that one evening a man and a woman came staggering to a house where an old\n",

At that time their food consisted chiefly of potatoes and oatenmeal, but in 1846 a disease struck the potato crop now known as blight. The people of that time knew of no remedy to save the crop and they turned out a complete failure. Men were known to go out to the field in the morning and dig all day without getting a sound potato and before the years was out the people where in a state of starvation. The British government came to the aid of the Irish people and sent in Indian meal which was known at the time as \"Buck meal\" as it was its first appearance in this country. It was given out at different centres there was one pound of meal per day allowed for each person. Some of the people had to travel several miles to secure it and they were often known to die by the roadside with weakness for want of sufficient food. There were also large sums of money sent from other countries to provide clothing for the people. But the people who got change of the money who were the local Gentry of that time instead of providing them with food and clothing, made them go out to make new roads and to improve the old ones\n",

Skin disease the result of starvation and exposure were common. The population of Ireland reduced to near the half before the country recovered.My grandmother (who was then Catherine Best Clincollow) and my great grandfather (Mr. G.

They used to cut the sound bits off and grind them in a quern and ring them and make boxty out of them. My great grandfather (Mr. W.

He also pointed out one of the fields on his farm, where a boiler was kept busy by stalwart young men who earned good money by making stirabout.  It was called \"Parnell's Meal\" and parties were coming from early morning until night, for their feed of porridge which was measured out in noggins.  There were oat cakes or bannocks as the were called baked at the said mill and sold at a penny or so, to anyone who could afford it.  Every house was visited by some sort of fever, and then the family could use nothing but sweet milk boiled, needless to say whole households were wiped out.

      "Transcription: The old people told many stories about the Great Famine of 1846, '47 but I think some of the stories were somewhat enlarged as it was not a general famine throughout Ireland. No doubt there were seven and a half millions of a population in Ireland at that time. The large or medium sized farmers did not suffer very much. Certainly the poorer classes suffered much as their chief food consisted of potatoes in the Winter period and the potatoes were a total failure for a few years but the farmer grew corn, barley, rye, bere and other cereals so that they did not suffer much for the want of food.The bere crop was ready to eat in the end of June so that the men with land always had food of their own. Of course the cost of living then was nothing in comparison to what it is at the present time. Clothing, tailoring, boots, farming utensils and in fact everything was cheap and very few in this district suffered from hunger. My father, one of thirteen in the family was fourteen years of age at the time and they were reared on a little over three Irish acres and I never heard him say that any of them were hungry.\n",

The year before the famine there were as much potatoes at one house as would do six families. They could not get use for the potatoes as they had no pigs to eat them, so they threw them behind ditches, and in rivers to rot, and the next year the famine came and the people say that it was what happened the year before  that caused it. Not  very many people died in this district, but  they got a lot of diseases, and a man in the district had a spell, and used cure some of the people by making flax threads and tying them on the people.When almost all the people were dead with the hunger there was a boiler erected at Garryowen where each family  used get a quantity of Indian meal porridge every  week.

On the Meath border, can be seen Gallowshill, 308 feet high, where criminals were executed in early times. Further on the hill of Tara can also be seen in clear weather.Adjacent to the site where the old residence stood is the historical spot, where it is said Cromwell addressed his troops prior to his march on Dundalk.

No doubt  there were  seven and a half millions of a population  in Ireland  at that time. The large  or medium  sized farmer  did not suffer very much. Certainly  the poor classes   suffered much as their chief  food consisted of potatoes  in the Winter period  and the potatoes were a total failure for a few years  but the farmers  grew corn,  barley, rye, bere and other  cereals  so that  they did not suffer much for want of food.The bere crop  was ready to cut in the end of June so that  the men  with land always had food  of their own. Of course the cost of living then   was nothing in comparison  to what it is at the present time.  Clothing, tailoring, boots, farming utensils and in fact  everything  was cheap and very  few in this district  suffered  from hunger.

The potatoes became the chief food of the Irish people. At that time there were eight million people in Ireland and after the famine there were only four million. Between 1800 and 1845 there was a potato famine in several districts, but the famine which began in 1845 was far worse than any of the other famines. In that year the potato blight appeared in Ireland for the first time. It spread quickly and the crop failed all over the country. At that time there was no such thing as spraying the potatoes.The people had neither food nor money to but the potatoes. Thousands of people died of sickness and starvation in the winter. Raw turnips, weed and seaweed were eaten. The people went through the fields and gathered the wild weeds. They boiled theme with salt and they lived on them without a potato. You can think of their horror and despair when the potato blight again appeared. Hundreds of thousands of people in the famine years seeing nothing but starvation for them at home, sold all they had and went to America. More than a million people left Ireland between the years 1845 and 1850.Every year thousands of young men and women went to America. Those who remained at home had no heart.

In this district there was a man who went round with the cart bringing three Coffins each time he went. He was collecting the dead bodies and bringing them to the place of burial. There were often two  corpses in each coffin. After the famine beggars were very plentiful. Any beggars that came into a house it was always the custom to give them  a noggin of butter milk and porridge. There was often plundering and stealing for food and money where it was known to be any.The famine effected this district very much as a great lot of people had to leave their homes , and some died from want . This district was dotted over with white wash Cottages before the famine.On my way there were eight cottages, four on the lower Hill,and three on another and one at the head of the garden.They had about nine of a family and about eight or nine and about eight or nine of two or three acres of land.

These people had been using greens and vegetables. This caused diarrhea which took their lives. There were hunger and much want but there was a good quantity of oatmeal in the hands of the farmers, and mealdealers had a surplus on hands from previous years. These supplies were husbanded with great care those having a good supply dividing it with their poorer neighbours.A story is told of Charles O Malley of Carn an uncle of Edward Melley and granduncle of Hugh Melley (mentioned above).This Charles O Malley lived and worked hard that whole season on one meal per day all the remainder he gave to some hungry or necessitous person.A pathetic story is told about a widow\n",

There was a protestant family in Clogher near a little river and they were in charge of a broth-house but they did not treat the Catholics properly. This family was named Gallachers. They were to give a canfull of broth to the Catholics every day but the measure was often stinted. There was a priest living near by named Father Glacan. The priest reproached the protestants and they had a mind to kill him. The priest said to himself that he would make them poor. These people had  six cows and the priest went in one night and asked the people in Irish did they smell anything? They said that they did not but when they arose in the morning the six cows were burned in the (morning) byre without the byre being burned. They begged his pardon again and they began to become rich by a miracle which he worked as a result of their acknowledging his power.Collected by Philomena Breslin, Summey,from her grandmother Mary Boyle, Tullyshane( age 78 years)\n",

Long ago about the year 1850 in the midst of a violent storm, and heavy seas a large ship was driven ashore from the Atlantic. She was badly damaged. Her sails were all blown away, and she was heading straight for the rocks. But with great skill the captain managed to avoid them, and ran her into this little clúdaigh where she was held fast, with her huge bow-sprit gripped firmly on the sloping rocks. By this means the captain, and his crew succeeded in reaching land by climbing out on the (boy) bow-sprit. But in doing so the captain got his leg badly crushed. However they must have been thankful to reach land safely. They were taken to the nearest house where they got every care and attention. After they recovered from their experience they preceeded on their way. The ship became a total wreck, and from that time forth this clúdaigh was called sceilp na luinge.\n",

It was said that the captain managed to get ashore only to die later on. The ship was plundered by the natives of that district.Parts of this ship are still in evidence. There are two thick wooden pillars in a garage in Ramelton supporting the roof which were parts of the masts, and the ship's bell is in possession of some person in Rathmullan.\n",

Some people made fires behind the hedges and made porridge there, and it was said that is was the first time for Indian meal to come to Ireland. All the people gathered for the porridge. This porridge was called Relief Porridge.During the Famine the people had even to eat the skins of potatoes that they had thrown out before, because they were so hungry. My grandfather's father and another man went out to gather the potatoes early in the morning and they had not as many potatoes as would have satisfied four persons at dinner time.The potatoes were not sown in\n",

It was a disease that came on the potatoes and in those days the people had no remedies as we have nowadays. The people knew nothing about spraying. The majority of the people of Ireland were living mainly on potatoes before that so when the potatoes were scarce they got very little to eat. They had no food to eat, nor money to buy any, and they gathered weeds, which  they boiled, put salt on and ate.\n",

Here is the story.The Whiskey Man was, as one might expect, a man who drank too much whiskey. He was a small stout, kindly fellow, well liked by all his neighbours, although he was rarely sober. Notwithstanding the fact that he was in a continuous state of intoxication, he was never known to act violently or vulgarly. He seemed to exist solely on whiskey, hence his nickname. His real name seems to have been entirely forgotten.However there came a day, when this Whiskey Man had no money left to pay for his whiskey and since he craved for it and had now reached the stage that he had to have it to exist, he built himslef a neat little still house, with the necessary apparatus, among the gorse bushes.

The sound came nearer, passed overhead, and went on. They followed. Presently a bell fell down as if from the sky, it was like a dinner bell. They picked it up and took it home. Some still living say they have seen the bell. One solution that has been suggested is that a balloon was drifting in the fog and lost its bearings and was ringing a bell in order to get some notion where they were.

It stopped at Ractan a mountain. In place of rain he saw a plough and a swingle tree and a foot tree and it on fire. He went into the house and told his father that he saw a fire in the sky, his father told him that there would be a famine. In two days there was not a potato on earth to be got except skeedens (worthless potatoes)  Next year any person who set those skeedens had a good crop.\n",
