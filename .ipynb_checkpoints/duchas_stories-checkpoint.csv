The Famine · Cloigeann · Bailiúchán na Scol | dúchas.ie,During the years of the famine the potatoes rotted in the ground. The people had nothing else to eat and when this failed they died here and there on roads and in fields. Some lived a long time on a root they used to dig out of the ground. There were no coffins but on the people that died. They had a box with hinches on the bottom and when they would come to the grave they used to open the bottom and let the person drop into the grave. In that way the one coffin did all the people.

The people were very poor at that time, because they had not much land, and they used not sow but the potatoes, and when the blight came on them they had nothing to eat, and they died.They used to leave their houses and go around from place to place looking for something to eat.A man was bringing his wife into the workhouse one time when he met Father Duggan the parish priest of Cummer who gave him a little food for the road. The next day the same man came again and told him that he heard the woman was dead.""I do not think she could be dead yet, but go in quickly for fear they would bury her alive"" said Father Duggan.

So when the potato crop failed the people saw nothing before them but starvation. All the potatoes they used to grow in olden times would not amount to half of what we grow nowadays. What they had during the famine years were not worth digging. They would start digging in the morning and they would not have the fill of a bucket in the evening which was a very small supply for a big family.Some people dug them and as they were too small to plant as usual they shook them as we shake oats nowadays and covered them with a grape.It is said that those who sowed them in this manner had a fair crop the following year.The famine affected this district in this way, hundreds died from hunger and from the effects of the famine and fever which always follows hunger"

In this way many bodies were laid in the fields or in the ditches because the people were too weak to carry them any farther.

Thousands died from starvation.As there were no newspapers in those days it was a long time before the people in England heard anything about the famine. As soon as they heard about it they sent over ship loads of “Indian Meal.”At first when the English gave the Irish the meal they were so hungry they did not wait to cook it but ate it just as it was as they had been so long without food the raw meal killed them as quickly as starvation so the English had to cook the meal for them in huge boilers on the Coach road.

They thought it was ghosts. In the morning they saw one man had been buried alive and had got up and staggered over to the wall for shelter. Often they did not even bury them in the graveyard but in a ditch or field in order to save time. The fathers of the children used to go away from the house during the day.

This was caused by “Blight”At that time the people in this district suffered very great hardships. At least two thirds of the people died of hunger or fever. In many places traces of large villages are seen where the inhabitants were all wiped out by the “famine”.So great indeed was the number dead that coffins could not be procured and the dead were rolled up in blankets or sheets and buried in roughly dug graves. In Boyle a cart went around collecting the dead bodies and the old people say that it was a pitiful sight to see the cart with its tragic load travelling along the street followed by a few famished mourners.The Government relief was a great boon to the poor starved people. Loaves of “Black Bread” and bags of “Indian Meal” were to be seen every Sunday at the Chapel gate. These were distributed among the very poor.

She had ten children and no means of supporting them. One evening, after sunset as the widow was walking round the fort talking to herself, she met a little woman who asked her what was troubling her. The widow said she was very worried because she had no food for her children except water cress or sorrel, or nettles or sometimes a fish which she caught in the river. The little woman told the widow to come to the fort next morning and she would find there a cow which would give her milk for her children. The widow did as she was told and she found not only the cow but a calf as well. The cow gave plenty of milk all year except during the winder when she went dry. The widow was again sorely troubled and again the little woman came to her aid. She told the widow to leave the cow back in the fort at night, and on the following morning she would find another cow in her stead. Every winter the same thing happened. The widow left the dry cow in the fort and got in her stead a fresh cow and a calf. When all the children were able to provide for themselves they no longer got the cow and calf."

The poorer class dug in their bogs for ""briscains"" which are white roots and tried to keep themselves alive by eating them. People died in dozens in this district because the old people say that plenty of people died on the roads and are buried inside the ditches.

This tract of land is fertile and for generations has been in the possession of protestants of the tilled class. The lands are called the Grange and the Rectory. The Grange was owned by the Whites and Fitzpatricks, who were titled people in England and the parson lived in the Rectory till recent years. We generally find that the English resided on the lands of the old monastries and that is why I claim that St Creigharees monastry was in the Glebe and not far from the place where his holy well commemorates his name."

Just ninety one years ago on November 2nd 1847 there occurred there the shooting of Rev. John Lloyd, Smith Hill, Elphin who was returning from Divine Service in Aughrim.  It appears the Rev. gentleman was what was then known as a middle landlord and the misguided men were under the belief that his death would solve the agrarian difficulties then prevalent.  Three men engaged in the attack but the first failed whereupon the second took the gun.   The clergyman saw and divined the intentions of the men and baring his breast bade them 'fire away' facing with proud courage his assailants whereupon he was shot dead.  In the horse-drawn trap was a youth named Stanley with the Rev. J. Lloyd.  Stanley afterwards identified his master's murderers.  Two of the men paid the extreme penalty and one whilst awaiting trial died in his cell.  The clergyman's religion had no connection with the cause of the attack.  Great regret in all circles existed around Elphin on learning of the outrage as the Rev. gentleman was an excellent employer and a very charitable neighbour in those distant and awful times when famine swept the land."

All the sick and hungry people were put in there and it also gave work to some people, to get food and to take care of those people. It was a great improvement to the poor people, but the Sinn Féinn men of nineteen sixteen burned it fearing the English Soldiers would come to live there. The four walls of it are still to be seen."

In our district, it is common when the old people meet, to discuss that dreadful time; and tell some of the stories to the younger folk.One of these stories is as follows. This family lived in Glen, and lived happily there previous to the famine. But when the potatoes failed, which was then their staple food, they were in great distress. The parents did their utmost to provide sufficient for a while, but soon had to surrender. They saw their dear little ones starve of hunger, one by one, until the six were gone.Then the mother, who had so far struggled on, fell victim, while her husband eat the very grass of the fields. He was the only member who survived, but not for a long period, as he had gone too far when relief came."

Then the approach of Sunday without Mass, almost broke her heart. This Sunday however, she no longer remained at home, but attempted her fatal journey. She had scarcely a mile to walk, but it seemed endless to her. The Almighty however enabled her to get to Church before Mass had finished. She entered at the moment of the Elevation and fell dead saying ""Eternal Praises to the Son of God.""When Mass was ended the poor creature was removed to her home, where her only son was found dead.Such were the occurrences of famine times."

He was O'Sullivan by name, and he died from the effects of the famine. There was a man passing by, who found the corpse and with help from the neighbours buried him in a plane field. Consecrated ground was out of the question during that time.Two men were found dead in a house above Nadd. They were two brothers named Driscolls. They were sitting beside the fire just as if they were only resting. Many others died in a similar state at that time.There was a Mr. Twomey who held a small farm in the Derrygowna district at this time. As was the general cry then, his potato crop failed and he was so much in need of food, that he sold his farm for a basket of potatoes. When he got the potatoes, he so weak and worn out, that he was unable to use them."

His house was situated close to a pump, from which he got sufficient water.He owned a small pit of potatoes, and one day he decided to turn them, for fear of any decay. To his sorrow and surprise he had only one ticket of sound ones. Needless to mention, this supply did not last very long, so after a little while, he was forced to eat, even grass, and drink water. Certainly he did not survive long on this nourishment, and one day he was found dead in his own cabin.Such occurrences were very numerous in this district, during the famine period."
"The Famine Years · Glaise Buí, Malla · The Schools' Collection | dúchas.ie",The famine years occurred during 1846-47. These were years of hunger and starvation. During the famine years the potato crops failed and on this account the people died of hunger as potatoes were their chief food. People were found dead so plentiful by the sides of fences that it was impossible to bury them. There were three men living together in a little house in Gloundine. After a few days they had what food was available in the house eaten and soon after all three died of hunger. When the neighbours found they were dead they gathered together and threw in the house on them. On another occasion a poor man called to Con Callaghan's house at Gloundine. There was a keeler of stirabout boiled and ready on the table for the family. Con's grandmother went to milk the cows and when she returned to the kitchen she found the stirabout was all ate and the old man was nowhere to be seen. Later in the evening he was found dead by a fence a little distance from the house.

The people who survived, too weak themselves to bring them to a graveyard only dug a hole as near as they could to where the person died, and they used to drag them along the ground and drop them into the hole and cover them again.  The food any rich farmer had was Indian meal and they used to boil the meal down and eat it.

There was no seed to set the crop for the following year.  The people had to live on turnips, and some had to steal them to try and live.In 1848 things were worse, there were no potatoes at all, and again the people died in hundreds of thousands."

Over a million people emigrated to England, Canada, the United States and the west India islands during that period. It is also estimated that over a million people died from the shortage of food and the sicknesses following. A university student from cambridge who was travelling the country at that time said that the country side which he passed through was completely desolated. When he did meet people they were like corpses eating in many instances the grass of the fields to keep them alive because potato crops completely failed.Before that famine the Ballyhahill district was thickly populated. Many ruins of houses can be seen where people then lived. At that time the potato crop was a complete failure. People had to go to Tarbert in those days for meal. One day as they were going to Tarbert they found a dead man on the road with grass in his mouth. It seems that he began to eat the grass and he died. They had to live on meal and turnips and nettles for a long time, and they swelled up and died.That famine was called the ""black forty-seven"".

There was such misery and poverty, when the potato crop failed, owing to bad wet weather in 1846-47, that they hated to talk of those dreadful days. The thought of that black period brought back such bitter memories, that they never cared to dwell much on the subject.The district around was altogether very thickly populated in those times, and some of the country roads could be likened to streets, so thick were the houses. They were notable for the fact that all of them, it might be said were built along the roadside and belonged to poor people. They were made of mud, and have crumbled to dust long since, so that no traces of them are to be seen. But old people to-day can point on the spots, where mud cabins once stood.The farmers' houses on the other hand were built of stone, and stood some distance in from the raod. In the majority of the farm houses to-day, the occupants are descended from, and are the same flesh, and blood, as those who dwelt in them in 1846.
