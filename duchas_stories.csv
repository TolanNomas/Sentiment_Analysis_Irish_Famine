The Famine · Cloigeann · Bailiúchán na Scol | dúchas.ie,During the years of the famine the potatoes rotted in the ground. The people had nothing else to eat and when this failed they died here and there on roads and in fields. Some lived a long time on a root they used to dig out of the ground. There were no coffins but on the people that died. They had a box with hinches on the bottom and when they would come to the grave they used to open the bottom and let the person drop into the grave. In that way the one coffin did all the people.

The people were very poor at that time, because they had not much land, and they used not sow but the potatoes, and when the blight came on them they had nothing to eat, and they died.They used to leave their houses and go around from place to place looking for something to eat.A man was bringing his wife into the workhouse one time when he met Father Duggan the parish priest of Cummer who gave him a little food for the road. The next day the same man came again and told him that he heard the woman was dead.""I do not think she could be dead yet, but go in quickly for fear they would bury her alive"" said Father Duggan.

So when the potato crop failed the people saw nothing before them but starvation. All the potatoes they used to grow in olden times would not amount to half of what we grow nowadays. What they had during the famine years were not worth digging. They would start digging in the morning and they would not have the fill of a bucket in the evening which was a very small supply for a big family.Some people dug them and as they were too small to plant as usual they shook them as we shake oats nowadays and covered them with a grape.It is said that those who sowed them in this manner had a fair crop the following year.The famine affected this district in this way, hundreds died from hunger and from the effects of the famine and fever which always follows hunger"

In this way many bodies were laid in the fields or in the ditches because the people were too weak to carry them any farther.

Thousands died from starvation.As there were no newspapers in those days it was a long time before the people in England heard anything about the famine. As soon as they heard about it they sent over ship loads of “Indian Meal.”At first when the English gave the Irish the meal they were so hungry they did not wait to cook it but ate it just as it was as they had been so long without food the raw meal killed them as quickly as starvation so the English had to cook the meal for them in huge boilers on the Coach road.

They thought it was ghosts. In the morning they saw one man had been buried alive and had got up and staggered over to the wall for shelter. Often they did not even bury them in the graveyard but in a ditch or field in order to save time. The fathers of the children used to go away from the house during the day.

This was caused by “Blight”At that time the people in this district suffered very great hardships. At least two thirds of the people died of hunger or fever. In many places traces of large villages are seen where the inhabitants were all wiped out by the “famine”.So great indeed was the number dead that coffins could not be procured and the dead were rolled up in blankets or sheets and buried in roughly dug graves. In Boyle a cart went around collecting the dead bodies and the old people say that it was a pitiful sight to see the cart with its tragic load travelling along the street followed by a few famished mourners.The Government relief was a great boon to the poor starved people. Loaves of “Black Bread” and bags of “Indian Meal” were to be seen every Sunday at the Chapel gate. These were distributed among the very poor.

She had ten children and no means of supporting them. One evening, after sunset as the widow was walking round the fort talking to herself, she met a little woman who asked her what was troubling her. The widow said she was very worried because she had no food for her children except water cress or sorrel, or nettles or sometimes a fish which she caught in the river. The little woman told the widow to come to the fort next morning and she would find there a cow which would give her milk for her children. The widow did as she was told and she found not only the cow but a calf as well. The cow gave plenty of milk all year except during the winder when she went dry. The widow was again sorely troubled and again the little woman came to her aid. She told the widow to leave the cow back in the fort at night, and on the following morning she would find another cow in her stead. Every winter the same thing happened. The widow left the dry cow in the fort and got in her stead a fresh cow and a calf. When all the children were able to provide for themselves they no longer got the cow and calf."

The poorer class dug in their bogs for ""briscains"" which are white roots and tried to keep themselves alive by eating them. People died in dozens in this district because the old people say that plenty of people died on the roads and are buried inside the ditches.

This tract of land is fertile and for generations has been in the possession of protestants of the tilled class. The lands are called the Grange and the Rectory. The Grange was owned by the Whites and Fitzpatricks, who were titled people in England and the parson lived in the Rectory till recent years. We generally find that the English resided on the lands of the old monastries and that is why I claim that St Creigharees monastry was in the Glebe and not far from the place where his holy well commemorates his name."

Just ninety one years ago on November 2nd 1847 there occurred there the shooting of Rev. John Lloyd, Smith Hill, Elphin who was returning from Divine Service in Aughrim.  It appears the Rev. gentleman was what was then known as a middle landlord and the misguided men were under the belief that his death would solve the agrarian difficulties then prevalent.  Three men engaged in the attack but the first failed whereupon the second took the gun.   The clergyman saw and divined the intentions of the men and baring his breast bade them 'fire away' facing with proud courage his assailants whereupon he was shot dead.  In the horse-drawn trap was a youth named Stanley with the Rev. J. Lloyd.  Stanley afterwards identified his master's murderers.  Two of the men paid the extreme penalty and one whilst awaiting trial died in his cell.  The clergyman's religion had no connection with the cause of the attack.  Great regret in all circles existed around Elphin on learning of the outrage as the Rev. gentleman was an excellent employer and a very charitable neighbour in those distant and awful times when famine swept the land."

All the sick and hungry people were put in there and it also gave work to some people, to get food and to take care of those people. It was a great improvement to the poor people, but the Sinn Féinn men of nineteen sixteen burned it fearing the English Soldiers would come to live there. The four walls of it are still to be seen."

In our district, it is common when the old people meet, to discuss that dreadful time; and tell some of the stories to the younger folk.One of these stories is as follows. This family lived in Glen, and lived happily there previous to the famine. But when the potatoes failed, which was then their staple food, they were in great distress. The parents did their utmost to provide sufficient for a while, but soon had to surrender. They saw their dear little ones starve of hunger, one by one, until the six were gone.Then the mother, who had so far struggled on, fell victim, while her husband eat the very grass of the fields. He was the only member who survived, but not for a long period, as he had gone too far when relief came."

Then the approach of Sunday without Mass, almost broke her heart. This Sunday however, she no longer remained at home, but attempted her fatal journey. She had scarcely a mile to walk, but it seemed endless to her. The Almighty however enabled her to get to Church before Mass had finished. She entered at the moment of the Elevation and fell dead saying ""Eternal Praises to the Son of God.""When Mass was ended the poor creature was removed to her home, where her only son was found dead.Such were the occurrences of famine times."

He was O'Sullivan by name, and he died from the effects of the famine. There was a man passing by, who found the corpse and with help from the neighbours buried him in a plane field. Consecrated ground was out of the question during that time.Two men were found dead in a house above Nadd. They were two brothers named Driscolls. They were sitting beside the fire just as if they were only resting. Many others died in a similar state at that time.There was a Mr. Twomey who held a small farm in the Derrygowna district at this time. As was the general cry then, his potato crop failed and he was so much in need of food, that he sold his farm for a basket of potatoes. When he got the potatoes, he so weak and worn out, that he was unable to use them."

His house was situated close to a pump, from which he got sufficient water.He owned a small pit of potatoes, and one day he decided to turn them, for fear of any decay. To his sorrow and surprise he had only one ticket of sound ones. Needless to mention, this supply did not last very long, so after a little while, he was forced to eat, even grass, and drink water. Certainly he did not survive long on this nourishment, and one day he was found dead in his own cabin.Such occurrences were very numerous in this district, during the famine period."
"The Famine Years · Glaise Buí, Malla · The Schools' Collection | dúchas.ie",The famine years occurred during 1846-47. These were years of hunger and starvation. During the famine years the potato crops failed and on this account the people died of hunger as potatoes were their chief food. People were found dead so plentiful by the sides of fences that it was impossible to bury them. There were three men living together in a little house in Gloundine. After a few days they had what food was available in the house eaten and soon after all three died of hunger. When the neighbours found they were dead they gathered together and threw in the house on them. On another occasion a poor man called to Con Callaghan's house at Gloundine. There was a keeler of stirabout boiled and ready on the table for the family. Con's grandmother went to milk the cows and when she returned to the kitchen she found the stirabout was all ate and the old man was nowhere to be seen. Later in the evening he was found dead by a fence a little distance from the house.

The people who survived, too weak themselves to bring them to a graveyard only dug a hole as near as they could to where the person died, and they used to drag them along the ground and drop them into the hole and cover them again.  The food any rich farmer had was Indian meal and they used to boil the meal down and eat it.

There was no seed to set the crop for the following year.  The people had to live on turnips, and some had to steal them to try and live.In 1848 things were worse, there were no potatoes at all, and again the people died in hundreds of thousands."

Every house had to be numbered and the names of the people who dwelt in every house written on a sheet of paper and placed behind the back of the door.  Some of the bridges were torn up so as to prevent the Tans from travelling.  A lorry of those men came to Kildimo creamery.  They arrested all the men who were there and carried them away to close up some of these bridges.Shortly afterwards the Black and Tans came and burnt down the creamery so as to prevent the farmers form carrying on their work.

The help came and they were called ""Black and Tans"" and the reason they were called that name was because when they first came to Ireland they had no uniform so they wore the clothes of the police and the soldiers and the colours of those clothes were dark blue or black and tan, so the people called them ""Black and tans"".  They went around the country in lorries with rifles, machine guns and bayonets.  They beat the people and raided the houses of those who they thought were connected with the Sinn Fein movement.

Things now turned black when in 1846 the potatoes rotted in the ground or in the pits. At first the stalks turned black and withered away. Thinking it better to dig the potatoes the people made pits of them but they became black and were not fit to be eaten. The poor peasants died now of starvation because they depened merely upon the potatoes.Ship loads of wheat were exported every day and now the people had no substance for making butter bread. Their breakfast sometimes consisted of fine meal and milk. Every day before noon the poor people were seen by the lake gathering water-cresses, nettles ect, for their dinner.In twenties they died each day and were seen lying by road-side with their mouths green from nettles. A man named Mooney who lived in Louyhguir had plenty of money and he helped his neighbours as far as he could. It is said that he fed about 20 people each day. How he produced the food is unknown.

The population of Ireland at that time was nine millions, but it is only half that at present.The people died like flies by the hedges and ditches.  About one million died of hunger and a million emigrated to America.Without the potatoes the Irish people had plenty wheat to support themselves but they had to export it to England.  Corn was sent from America to the aid of the starving Irish but the English used to sink the ships in the ports.In the townland of Montrice in the parish of Truagh, Barony of Lower Tulla, Co. Clare, where one family now resides, it was formerly occupied by thirty two families.  Then the government gave a grant to be expended on public works.  The men worked for 4s a day, the women for 2s and the little boys for 1s. They also distributed free meal to the starving people.On one occasion a man died of hunger coming down to Broadford for the free meal.  They also gave employment by making high fences.  One time a man had two sons making those fences and they had boiled turnips and Indian meal for their supper."

When the following spring came the people had no seeds to plant except the decayed ones. In these times the population was double what it is now. It was estimated to be over eight millions. The disaster in a thickly populated country was something terrible. Many people are said to have died of hunger or of a disease caused by the starvation. Of course it is a true word to say that many emigrated to foreign countries to escape the hunger.

It happened one year that a change came upon the potato stalk when it was nearly fully grown.  This change caused teh stalk which was always a green colour to turn brown as if it were burned and it decayed.  This caused the potato to rot and so started off the famine.  As the farmers never saw this disease before they knew no remedy to cure it.  Scarcety of food set in and poverty and starvation stared the people in the face.  Soon people began to die of hunger as their supply of food was used.  People got sick and fever and many other diseases broke out and spread through the country.  People were dying of hunger in hundreds as the government was able to give very little assistance.  Brendan Walle 3rd/8/1938Teller Lot Malone

People who were rich and who could afford to pay their passage looked forward with great excitement to the maiden voyage of this great vessel for which she was completely booked. She left Southhampton and from the time of her departure until she met with her awful fate everyone on board was in great spirits. There were (some) amusements of every kind including a tennis-court, on this ship.We learn from survivors of this vessel that there was no depression. The commander of this ship was warned by a passing vessel of the oncoming danger. But being fearless of anything tragic occurring took no notice of the warning. In mid Atlantic she was struck by an iceberg and went headlong to her doom. There were some survivors but the majority of the people including millionaires were drowned. The passengers and the crew who remained on the vessel sang to the music of the band playing, “Nearer, my God to Thee” and they went down with the ill-fated Titanic."

Work began at 6 o clock in the morning and finished at 6 in the evening.  Even in winter work took place at the same hours, lamps being utilised in the darkness.  This meant that the men had to leave home at 3 o clock in the morning, and walk to work and return in the same way, reaching home at about nine o clock.  They took their supper of Indian meal and went to bed, while the women folk remained up to prepare the Indian meal for the morning and call them in time.

Tarleton, friend of Thompsons, was passing by riding on a white horse.  He stopped to look at the work and while there a man came up out of a drain, staggered around and fell in a faint.

"Famine Times · Cadamstown, Kinnitty · The Schools' Collection | dúchas.ie",The great famine of 1846-1847 did not effect this district.  A Saint named Cuddy lived here and he said no person would die of famine or plague.  The mill was working in Cadamstown during the famine.  It had a store of wheat and this was given out to the people of the parish free.  There is a site on Knockhill where a family were living in the famine.  One day a landlord came and evicted them and threw out their breakfast in the year.The Government gave relief then.  They made the Curragh Road and the Generals Road.  Sickness followed the hunger and this killed thousands of people.  About that time there was a woman teaching in a school in Lacaroe.  Her name was Mrs Elliot.  Catholics and Protestants attended her.  One day a priest went in and rebuked her for teaching the Protestant Bible.  He told her she would die suddenly.  One night when she was going to the bedroom the chimney fell in and killed her immediately.

One evening a yellow fog appeared, emitted a peculiar odour.  In one night or so the potatoes of the country-side were blighted.  The people became sad at the prospect before them.  The farmers and their wives sat on the fence all day and when spoken to they they answered not but shook their heads.  They tried every means to preserve them.  They had lime and chemicals.  All were no good.  When the pits were open the potatoes were rotton from end to end.  The"

Famine Times · Askamore · The Schools' Collection | dúchas.ie,"In the year 1846-47 we had a great Famine which effected the district very much owing to the failure of the potato crop. Many people lost their lives through poverty and hardship and others  went to America because of hunger.At  that period people lived mainly on potatoes and turnips, but when the blight came on the potato crop, nearly all the potatoes were destroyed. They could not afford to eat  the potatoes that escaped , as they wanted them for seed for the following year.Then the Goverment  sent out a relief of Indian meal at 2s 6d per stone.To spare this meal, the people used to mix boiled turnips with it. A story is told that on one occasion that Mr. Doyle, Carnew, Parish of Tomacork, Co. Wicklow,had only 2s 5d and he went to a shop to buy a stone of meal, but he was not allowed the meal without the other penny.It was only the well to do farmers who had any turnips to mix with the meal. Mr. John Murphy, Co. Wexford  was put in prison for stealing two turnips to mix with the meal when he was  coming home from work.

He was born in the village of Newcastle, Co. Wicklow, about the year 1766, as far as can be ascertained and grew to manhood amidst the peaceful grandeur of the Wicklow Hills, ""the Garden of Ireland. But the surrounding of his upbringings had no good effect on"
Gallows Hill · Newcastle · Bailiúchán na Scol | dúchas.ie,"Situated close to the old main road and only a short distance from the old castle is a hill known locally as the ""Gallows Hill"".This hill was a scene of many brutal murders and hangings during 1798. On the southern slope of the hill was an old ash tree on the hedge of a field adjoining the house at present owned by Mr. Mc. Enery. It was from one of the old boughs of this tree that the hangman's rope was suspended. Underneath this tree was a very deep hole or well about five feet wide into which the unfortunate victims were thrown.About 200 yards from this tree, in the same field adjoing adjoining the old main road was an old jail in which the prisoners were kept for some time before being brought to the gallows. Though this jail was about eleven yards wide and fifteen yards long there are only two parts of the walls are left. The other parts are almost invisible being entirely overgrown with moss forming little banks which indicate the shape of the building. This jail may have been built a long time as the material used in it is like that of the castle and can scarcely be broken up."

All the food they had was a small quantity of Indian meal which they used get boiled in the neighbouring houses. There were big boys and girls working on it and they barefooted. The year before the famine there were as much potatoes at one house as would do six families. They could not get use for the potatoes as they had no pigs to eat them, so they threw them behind ditches, and in rivers to rot, and the next year the famine came and the people say that it was what happened the year before  that caused it. Not  very many people died in this district, but  they got a lot of diseases, and a man in the district had a spell, and used cure some of the people by making flax threads and tying them on the people.When almost all the people were dead with the hunger there was a boiler erected at Garryowen where each family  used get a quantity of Indian meal porridge every  week. At last the people got disgusted with this way and Parnell began to give out meal at different  centres and the Protestants used get the most of it, and afterwards the priests  got it given to the  Catholics."

The people also grew  bear meal and they used cut some of this every day and dry it and grind it with querns and it would then be used. During the famine period the people ate a lot  of turnips and cabbage and this kind  of food gave them many diseases which they   died from.The inhabitants of Drogheda died from a disease  called ""the collar"" but this disease did not spread to this part of the country. After three million people died with the  hunger there was a few pounds sent from England for all the poor starving people  of this country. The people were so poor at that time that they had to be buried in sheets, as they had no money to buy coffins. The year  of the famine there was a boiler erected at Bill Jameson's  house  Billis where the people used get a  small quantity of Indian meal porridge every week. At that time a woman in Drumfomina left a pot on the fire and went to two places for meal and got none and when she went to the third place, she got two stone of meal for six shillings. Luke Molloy"

Certainly  the poor classes   suffered much as their chief  food consisted of potatoes  in the Winter period  and the potatoes were a total failure for a few years  but the farmers  grew corn,  barley, rye, bere and other  cereals  so that  they did not suffer much for want of food.The bere crop  was ready to cut in the end of June so that  the men  with land always had food  of their own. Of course the cost of living then   was nothing in comparison  to what it is at the present time.

The population of Ireland was at that time eight millions. Thousands of the people died from hunger. The government (hat) had to start relief schemes.Men and women were put to make roads at very poor wages but they were glad to get the money as they had no other means. Boilers were also erected in every district to boil indian meal porridge and those who were in bad need got a small portion every day that was the first of the indian meal in Ireland. Emigration started the same year. Families went away from their homes and never came back. That is the reason we can see the ruins of so many houses.

Sceilp na Loinge · Cruit Island · The Schools' Collection | dúchas.ie,"Sceilp na LuingeSceilp na Luinge is situated in Cruit Island in the parish of Lower Templecrone. It got its name in this way. Long ago about the year 1850 in the midst of a violent storm, and heavy seas a large ship was driven ashore from the Atlantic. She was badly damaged. Her sails were all blown away, and she was heading straight for the rocks. But with great skill the captain managed to avoid them, and ran her into this little clúdaigh where she was held fast, with her huge bow-sprit gripped firmly on the sloping rocks. By this means the captain, and his crew succeeded in reaching land by climbing out on the (boy) bow-sprit. But in doing so the captain got his leg badly crushed. However they must have been thankful to reach land safely. They were taken to the nearest house where they got every care and attention. After they recovered from their experience they preceeded on their way. The ship became a total wreck, and from that time forth this clúdaigh was called sceilp na luinge."
